  Tell me are you dark?

 Is it dark in the box?

 Show me. Do you

 always have pride

 in your work?

 You have taught

 me well. Life

 is a flying pig and

 you are a closet.

 I live in the sky today

 and refuse to look

 down on my guy.

 Why did you hate

 your father? Why

 did you turn me

 into him? I live inside

 shapes for days, electric

 cables and clouds

 give me what I need.

 I’m for the man

 who drives the hammer.

 The ones left out

 in cold, at work,

 spirited, unchurched.
