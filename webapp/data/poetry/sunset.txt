                              Should it still be so

                               razor-edged & wondrous to see the sacrificial hordes of little men who tarp the sky carve 

                               vertical welts through the atmosphere, climbing up each gangly axon of ladder, moving—from

                               what I can see at my post—so diligently at first and then slowing, almost to a stall, seeming 

                               to dangle in the air, the near-shorn coat of an overgrown sheep swung just below the belly, 

                               attached by a few strong deluded fibers, or caught in the tropopause, perhaps on a 

                               malfunctioning glass elevator, gears flooded 

  

                               Thankfully, it’s all relative

                               at my computer screen I zoom and see their legs, half trapeze artists, half electricians, flexing 

                               so furiously upwards, I can near see the blood-spectres plucking their heels, un-see their backs 

                               turtled with the government-issued tools to blow out the circuits. I crunch numbers and recede 

                               into the final blue, preparing for each man to reach his Pinnacle, preparing to be awash with 

                               the same diffusive surprise that pierces the sky: a languorous explosion of color, the cheeks 

                               warm with guilt, caught, yellow laughter fat in the mouth, sluicing into the beard

  

                               Possibly the whole earth 

                               hyperventilates, averts her gaze from these maneuvers, lets it all unfold above her, cumulus. 

                               I want to shout *these are* your *men!* and make her kiss each sweaty forehead, each eye 

                               planted in its devout rubber mass of skin, but even in the end, rapturous decorum must be 

                               maintained: my uniform, its badges winking to no one, will stay buttoned to my neck, soon 

                               to be melded into my skin, long after the last man tessellates into place and dissolves. May 

                               those who follow note: I guard the button ready to transmit the go ahead & it’s my finger, 

                               so sure of the command, which trembles with breath—corporeal, sinewy, almost prayer

  

                                              *and what will be left of you? your Eyes! great, gleaming crystal* 

                                              *gophers migrating with the dark*
