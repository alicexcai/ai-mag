I wore her  
disorder as a  
raincoat  
for the spring of tears.  
I took her voice.  
  
Shivering, I  
went over  
the insights of her diary  
with a pen  
in a fat blue book that made up  
for my not having  
a body that spring.  
  
I wanted to be the man she loved  
who loved her  
shivering.  I wanted to know what it’s like  
to have desire.  
  
* *  
I went off  
to find it  
in the desert,  
which is savage  
  
but where rabbits are.  
And ravens,  
wise enough to know  
you have a gun  
when you walk across the field.  
I never plowed that field.  
  
On the low road  
hardly visible  
I took that gun to where the old car carcasses  
lay, thick with  
rabbits, &  
I plowed that field.  
I didn’t leave a grave.
