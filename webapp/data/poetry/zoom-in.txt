don't expect to be praised every time you raise a middle finger   detonator where an ending meets a beginning there's no way around it   you are busy modulating retractions this silence is curved it is a road   friendship tripping over us keeping us informed   you suspect these constants are disguises      desk   hangar  drawer   words as doors as if they had been expecting you   a perfect pitch does not always deal with basics   the ruination of the tango to indulge every impulse   & head for deadends   tell me you've got my back give me a moment to zoom in on the data   each lunacy is there to be spent   when the sun became needy i sent him a mail
