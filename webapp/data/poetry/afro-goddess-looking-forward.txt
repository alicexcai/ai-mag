*after Mickalene Thomas*  

When I look back over my life  
on how everything played out  
it was I who licked the salt from your pillar  
neck. Some days I chose to self-sabotage,  
some hours I resembled Orpheus, afraid  
we would never walk right up to the sun,  
hand-in-hand, my fingers stuck beneath your skirt.  
I looked to the hills from whence cometh my help.  
I lived in the history of the future where  
some of us would not die. When asked to keep on  
the straight and narrow, when presented  
with the lineup of Tom, Dick, and Harry,  
I ducked to enter a pink hole.  
When I forgot to mind my head,  
God looked over his shoulder.
