Look at the sad people barely putting up

 with the flight patterns of pollen.

 Look at them troubled by one more

 irritation in their lives.

 They will be the last ones standing

 when the great forests are felled

 and the imperious sunflowers are finally uprooted

 and the petulant grasses are tamed to law-abiding highways.

 Some poet will rise up to speak on behalf

 of the Bornean orangutan and the Ili pika

 and some Hollywood director will find the great composer

 of metaphors and the camera will worship

 her fingernails and eyelashes before he lets her fade

 behind the closing credits. He will whimper

 in the darkness, and like us, stumble towards

 the nearest pharmacy and run his hands

 pensively over the boxed nasal sprays

 knowing how difficult to read real estate reports

 when your eyes are stone and gravel and how

 difficult, too, listening to impenitent developers,

 styling their bejeweled class rings and tie-clips,

 whisper *property, property, property*.
