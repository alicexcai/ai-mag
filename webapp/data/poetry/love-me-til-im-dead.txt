  Wasn’t that 12th street

 wasn’t it May

 6:29 pm I was late

 I’d just bought

 Rob’s bildungsroman

 you mean memoir

 the bookseller

 working the cash

 register told me

 you’re on the wrong

 floor follow me

  

 Told him I also needed to taste

 what I was up against

  

 signing myself

 over to X agency

 who’ll take 15%

 of the rights

 of the royalties

 if they successfully

 peddle my memoir

 (whose takeaway

 is messing up love

 via capitalism)

 & hawk it to some

 Big Five publisher

 who’ll nary give

 a shit not until

 it officially bombs

 & who’ll change

 the French title

 to a phrase more

 marketable & also cut

 the photograph

 overlooking my third

 apartment before

 Sandy hit Brooklyn

 wasn’t that 2012

  

 6:31 pm I was skittering

 across Broadway

 my shoes killing me

 & read Rob’s first sentence

 (I needed also to *hear*

 what I was up against)

 “this must be the place”

 it both pleased

 & nonplussed me

 thought unwittingly

 of David Byrne

 in Hollywood

 c. 1984 onstage

 singing “sing

 into my mouth”

 & “never for money,

 always for love”

 his white suit

 & sweat stains

 wasn’t that

 *Stop Making Sense*

  

 (Emily loves this song

 I thought that’s

 what I’m up against?)

  

 Whacked the book

 shut & muttered

 *intéressant, intéressant*

 stretching the *a’s*

 & tittering at myself

 a tiny gag my horrid

 French accent

 an abandoned toast

 & thinking of X now

 you Francophile

 haven’t seen you

 since that winter

 3.5 years ago no

 that was Scholes St.

 when you wheezed

 & said I’m uncertain

 I’m that person

 who waking loves

 you anymore

  

 yes, *you*

 you said

  

 & headed eastbound

 when I looked up

 & also marching

 across 12th street

 there was another X

 I half-loved

 that following spring

 3.5 years ago she

 gave me this

 two-fingered salute

 touching her brow

 was she leaving

 her seminar maybe

 dinner with dad

 I wouldn’t decide

 thought unwittingly

 instead of her

 rheumy & I guess

 also pellucid

 eyes those nights

 on Powers St.

 on my stoop

 when the stars

 I said stunk of

 beef tallow

  

 My slack mouth

 making a shy noise

 when I saw her

 it was like *oh*

 but a century longer

  

 “Out of all those

  kinds of people,”

 my shoes sang

 & killing me

 “we drift in and out”

  

 & you could call

 her name but no

 you *live* here now

  

 *ain’t that America*

 on the radio

 when the taxi

 swerved around me

  

 & the drug dog

 licking anxiously

 the other bigger

 drug dog’s paws

  

 that was Broadway

 words like *jornada*,

 *chaparral*, *beldam*,

 *snow* *blindness*,

 *malanders*, *ilex*,

 *rebozo*, *chivaree*,

 *death* *camas*

  

 I bed down here now

  

 new whorls

 of blonde hair

 & fur in my mouth

  

 but when I wake up

 4:01 am unsleeping

 & the apartment’s

 glum-smelling

 like blue milk

 & mustard seed

  

 inside the amphora

 there’s a third smell

 a pair of ox-eyes

 with their bruised

 & drooped heads

 isn’t it those flowers

 some mornings

 who aren’t always

 already dead

 when I wake up

 & smell what

 I’m up against
