the brick path worn deep into so a bruise of moss blooms out beneath

 the surface of the whole—one day i stood

  

 upon a wicker seated chair & fell at once & that same thing took hold

 within both shins. a swollen marsh. among the cherry blossom trees

  

 at alishan, windows are made in certain trunks & crutches bear

 up certain limbs. the boardwalk

  

 opens for these bodies as devotional. the cedar forests

 blur the light with cedar fragrant mist, from a thousand year

  

 old stump mushrooms another, & that second stump in turn buds

 with the grandchild tree. roots murmuring through gills. a placard reads:

  

 the first sacred tree fell in a storm, whereupon local government

 arranged a fair election for another one. we arrive at bleachers

  

 semiluned around the newer tree, the vapor rises through us as a chill

 or memories of isthmus thin enough that on the road

  

 water entered into each eye, we drove a golf cart along the caesura of a long

 rhythmic line to somewhere murderers had once unearthed

  

 innumerable woman figurines. picture working the earth of the body

 open with one hand & stretching in

  

 for a shape of clay, of bone, of dark moss in your image. of jelly. for the seam

 of loam. under the skin’s a humid place

  

 you won’t want to stay long. now out of which

 i conjure a long line of mothers, each one sick in her slow way

  

 holding her cup of water, going towards bed. how tired she is, she says.

 can we not let her rest.
