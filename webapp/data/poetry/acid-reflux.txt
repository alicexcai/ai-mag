The way my doctor goes about it  
seems to allude that anything is a well  
some distance from total drainage.  
It is true that my body has endless  
things to say to you who touch me  
through the sleeve of this day mist.  
The earth was made too vain to consider  
that any one thing must gones for another  
to preen. All of the parts of me keep  
reaching like mimosas for touch  
and killing themselves. In the last of my most  
hopeless weeks in Boston as it was slow  
wintering my only pleasure was to drink  
glass after glass of orange juice by myself  
watching what could have been the end  
of my life. But I don’t think I can ever  
be finished; I’m in love with far too many  
countable things. And there are all their names  
to learn. Whatever you say I’ll plant  
a thousand flowers to retaliate. Always  
you want to be special in your nothing  
but there is the pail of your body working  
against its own current insisting  
with unweary voice there is no end  
just water on water on water.
