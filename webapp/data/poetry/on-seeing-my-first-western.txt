**1 / Meeting Burt**  
  
Burt Lancaster and I don’t   
have much to die for: love   
of the game and the gold  
and the girl not as much    
  
makes simple to say she’s not   
beautiful, perpetually   
never quite undressed,   
dusty and sweaty under  
that scarf, her dress, her   
face, wide plain, blessed   
expanse glistening daily   
above breasts long fought  
  
for, Burt and I, too old  
now to care about love.  
  
  
**2 / Losing Burt**  
  
The tropes gather faster when Burt appears,   
he’s lost craps and a woman, broke and rebuffed,    
smirking and grumbling that humans make love   
face to face, a remark worthy of some score-  
settling cowboy in spurs, not you, Burt, your  
single regard for time and rock blown rough  
in one moment’s furnace of sticks, sweaty, buffed,  
refusing objection your fusework near blears   
human loss so unsavory  
                                               I’m lost, Burt,  
can’t tell your face features through the sure  
group’s tactics and horses, making calm  
ill-advised, more fitting to flail and blurt  
guilt in tumid air that soaks these shores  
without oceans,  
                               Your hand is creased without a palm.  
  
  
**3 / Replacing Burt (On Seeing a Different Western)**  
  
Burt and I have had a falling out   
I say loud, hoping after a reaction,  
eyeing with verve and meaning my now   
and new loved outlaw, lanky Gary. Faction  
  
different this time, clean-shaven and freshly   
married, on the run not from the long   
law but the lawless. Blonde-sweet Miss Kelly  
headstrong and stupid—seems he’s on the wrong   
   
side of her Quaker complaints. He stays to greet  
a death mimed by cruel schoolboys. A crime  
for their sake. Boys scatter. Streets empty. Smutty heat,   
smutty Gary beneath the Marshall sign,  
  
moral and certain, leather and tallow.
