     
Consider also desired  
things. The currant  
in the navel under  
my long robe.  
  
A split in the lip  
 yields its hard red ball   
the one in the tip  
of a pen and as sore.   
Rough and parted.  
  
Coccyx pressing  
spine in sidesaddle  
I span head to tail  
scratching circles  
on the scalp to roil.  
  
A small machine  
a sphere in the corner  
of the room  
makes noise’s noise.  
Swamps the sticking  
swish of release.  
Is knowing.

   
You are here   
to carry—pour.
