born: drops, of water, of

 sliding, of walled air

 deciding *through,*

 *through*: the bough

 bows its gem-pimpled palm:

  

 yielding, desertion, one

 gesture, a fresco, the

  

 three lives (chaos

 clear flight and chaos) speak

  

 *nothing*; *rustle*;

 *nothing*: the hand

 behind’s a master’s: look,

  

 varnish in-

 -visible, doorholding

 air
