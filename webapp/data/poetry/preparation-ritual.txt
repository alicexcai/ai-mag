**Preparation ritual:** *You must atlas the vessel before burial. Sweeten* 

                                                                                                 *the thread that joins* 

              *the feet to the throat. From the groundwater in the uncontacted soil, draw out tasteless precious metal* 

 *that slides through your hands* 

  

 blessed Anthony I’m talking to you because I’ve bent myself like this before. And because there is 

                         something sleeping in my throat, 

                         a warmth growing 

  

                                                                     *like butter. Invite this glowing substance into your blood. Let it eat* 

                                                                     *the unlocking muscles, not so different from plant fiber. Let it fill* 

                                                                     *the chips and ridges and reach the cool center* 

  

 When I smoke, Anthony, feel it stir. 

 When I speak, feel it curl 

  

 *of the bone. Braid your hands into the reeds around you *                  

                                                The something burrowing in my blood? His back 

              lit through the window. 

                                      Anthony let me forget let me not 

                                      call his name in the grocery store. 

              *A river will blink back at you. Let that be action too. The river will* 

  

 *replace the ribs.* Let me forget the ridges 

 of his first teeth. *Watch the pitted sand* 

  

                                                                        *remove itself* 

                                                                                     *from the creases of your palms.*  

                                    It’s raining and our hands are backboned together over the gearshift at a stoplight. It’s  

                                    raining on TV and I’m still waiting. I’m waiting and the weather is failing to comply.  

                                    Anthony, I’m pushed right up against my skin. 

                                                                                                           *Kiss the wrists, thick* 

  

                                                                      *with mud and oil.* Look, 

                                    the repeated image of a consecrated body.  

                                                                      *Look, Anthony,* 

                                                there is nothing left to consecrate.
