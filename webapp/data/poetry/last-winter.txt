There is no winter but she saved

 two pomegranates for me

 from the deer and the salt

 winds. They grew into the window.

  

 Each year there are more fields

 let go to seed. She cannot

 stop planting even as the green

 up and envelopes her.

  

 I must count each leaf, stroke

 each new moss and name each.

 I must sit in one place until

 I have named and kissed each

  

 thing and then I turn to the next

 in my orderly radius and they keep

 sprouting exuberant and I

 am weary of counting the wildness.

  

 I do not know the seasons

 any longer coming as they do

 endlessly or never: here I am

 left counting the small and kind.
