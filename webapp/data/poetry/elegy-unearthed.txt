 
 *For Charlottesville*

 My city, hardly a city, still  
 swimming like a newborn—  
 two winters into this dream  
 the streets feel pale and distant.  
 I made my room so clean last night  
 I thought I might disappear, folding  
 laundry until the space looked smaller  
 like something out of a children’s book.  
 Or like Meg’s window in the corner of the television.  
 Or like an engine in reverse but heard  
 through playback. Last night in the dark  
 something seemed to give, so I scraped the salt-licked brick  
 for the heat beneath. In the newer version of this dream  
 everything is still red and distant  
 and August finds bodies pressed to the street  
 like too many petals collapsing. Each husk unearthed, unfolded  
 in my two steady hands. My city, I am trying to write my way  
 back to you, but out here I remember  
 only echo or ghost. Or these hands  
 shaking, all through the night.  
 Even in the body each story ends  
 outside of the body, and here in snowy Boston  
 something is left buried. Easily, like broken glass. Like light  
 bouncing off the sidewalk.
