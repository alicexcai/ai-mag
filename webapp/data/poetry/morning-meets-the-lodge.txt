Maui is across the finger of sea.  Four birds

 Abandon their trees and bob.

 I woke them up.  As I go to get my book

 I see a spiderweb marking each

 Room, and more besides.

 Mine wags and like a soap bubble is pastel.

 An empty hexagon marks where a fly was,

 At the top.  The spider is exactly in the middle.

  

 Three other spiders are in sight.  One wants

 To make his web where one’s web already is.

 Why don’t I see this more, one spider

 In another’s web?  Why is it this way, that the webless

 Seek the most precarious?

 Twenty-seven lines hold the marked web up.

                         *** 

 This island rose up to receive the bird but it

 Received the palm.  It was naked and

 Shallow and fish-shaped to mark its origin,

 Out of the sea.

 We swam in its mouth.  The coconut,

 Readied by a reflex in seawater, settles,

 Converting its own flesh into a tree.

  

 A bobbing coconut, readied by its passion, refuses

 To open.  No.  It lands and it opens

 Canopies.  It bursts and is still and frondlike is

 No spider.  The trunk achieves the sky.  Each frond

 Blackly breaks the light.
