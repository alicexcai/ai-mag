 

 In dreams, Mary comes draped beneath a veil, Dead

 Sea breaking at her feet, arms outstretched in that maternal

 welcoming. She wades waist-deep, covers her scars, not

 wanting to scare the children. Every mother’s duty:

 Keep the unholy origins hidden, those hauntings quiet.

 Like her, I cloak my immaculates in robes, send them off

 to learn. Soon they'll wonder, though, about the white

 detritus on my tongue when they come home, as I nod off

 mid-endearment, weighing hope against their smiles, our

 heavy goodnights before the tiny Mary in my well shakes

 her bottle full of pills, beckoning:

 Take, eat,

 in remembrance—

      And who am I not to answer my own heritable call?
