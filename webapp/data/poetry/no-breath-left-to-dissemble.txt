from appearance or action,  
              because there will not be another image of him  
              to superimpose upon the rest and sum over histories

 to derive an unwavering  
awareness of the person  
              inside him. I must now, on my own, perform the re-  
              construction while he still blows on the hair

on her neck though  
the pursuit is long-  
              forgotten and he dead afresh  
              has no breath left to dissemble.

He abused  
his talent, or,  
              misused is more potent a word  
              for his use of that naïve ability to reinvent

or be swayed such that  
beginnings happened  
              everywhere and always for him,  
              happened as each flees her own enemy. . .

Despairing of his own  
inner construction  
              he prolonged himself, not so skilled in self  
              -destruction, feeding *sterilem*, futile, *amorem*,

love with his own  
destruction or hope, sperando,  
              *nutrit*. What patina of desire (of care)  
              so often unpolished her skin

that skin morphed  
into bark  
              with arresting varnish, while she stood  
              wounded and rooted to the earth,

and she unmoving,  
became the pivot  
              about which unreason willed the act of turning,  
              dependence made mechanical and fixed,

reflexive even. I am  
left to wonder  
              will her foliage survive with his death  
              or will it fade along with the calculated forms

on his forearms—  
artistry, or, willingness—  
              perhaps his lyric or quivers (in death)  
              habebunt, *will have*, her still. If not,

perhaps in death  
he might  
              render her in alabaster not laurel  
              with sharper touch and blunter brambles

and perhaps then will I mourn.
