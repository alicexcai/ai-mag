The jet-drone of the river

      is deafening, shocked metal

 on sheet of black glass, the rotator

  

      a shriek of rattle-heat, power 

 into motion, limbs blown

      back. High above, flock of shrikes, 

  

 dark ornaments in branches

      leafless, bleached—

 a botched dividing, scrawled

  

      before winter, before

 freak fractals of snow, 

      before the fracked earth

  

 shatters far beneath. 

      I am but factual. Higher,

 in the black, unblinking 

  

      light of actual aircraft, of flight

 quiet as vectors. But up there nothing 

      moves: is it Venus, is it some star’s

  

 last siren, the workday over,

      compression over, light’s

 factory-whistle and called up years ago

  

      I am with you flying on aluminum wings 

 of no one’s making, black cows like rivets 

      gridding the brown field below,

  

 ice sheathing spiked turf, 

      sharp-tip, stalk, flat-feather—

 from soil these thousand beaks 

  

      hissing. We enter an eddy

 of cloud, the world

      whitewashed away,

  

 as outside us the hum grows,

      pale, hard, coiled,

 like a goiter in a bull’s throat.

  

      And is it in me now— 

 muttering, all sides

      the heavy, engined river,

  

 a hand dark as thirst raw

      on my tongue,

 when I am numb, when I

  

      am held down,

 when my eyes blow

      open: again the nerve the startle 

  

 the lurch of lift-off.
