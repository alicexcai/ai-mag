Manhattan is

 to approach Manhattan

  

 taking a yellow cab from JFK and

 still looking for it

 when I wonder will it show up

 asks my wife (same case

 when we went to see the Moroccan desert wasn’t it

 I calm her down

  

 it’s all about the approach

 Manhattan is

 its own desert (perhaps

  

 and finally

 like a distant mirage

 the silhouette of that throng of skyscrapers comes clear

 we are thrilled a little (from the oasis town of Erfoud lush with date palms

 thirty kilometers by Land Rover (beyond

 the tracts of dirt and rocks

 graceful (so exquisitely graceful

 golden swells of dunes rising (we

 were thrilled a little

  

 Manhattan is

 nothing but a marvel of nature (perhaps

  

 behind the neighboring (Queens?

 Brooklyn? buildings and billboards it slinks

 off and disappears (disappears

 and reappears (meanwhile

 growing more intense

 the pleasures of approach

 the anguish of approach

 in a mesh (Manhattan is

 growing more intense

  

 and then

 as though to shield it again

 an elevated subway’s rusty viaduct (rusty in pure bright auburn (behind

 which the throng of skyscrapers

 stand in contrast like the light and shade of America herself

  

 or (let’s put it this way

 if Manhattan were a gift for us

 it’s been decorated with rusty viaduct

 like a ribbon of crude joke

 and thrust at us (or

  

 Manhattan is

 pure ferocity (perhaps

 its gentle cage of rusty auburn shields it

 the cage vertically and diagonally (meshed like arabesque patterns

 ruddling our cheeks

  

 and yet

 the mesh unbinds and the city emerges (endlessly

 unbinds and (unbinds and (unbinds and it emerges

 the ribbon and cheeks left

 circumvented by a forest

 of throated hollows

  

 Manhattan is

 unbinding and emerging (unbinding and emerging

  

 suddenly

 having crossed the Queensboro Bridge

 we pull up short

 of a greeting

 to those throated hollows
