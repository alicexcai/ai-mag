The natural street-musician will follow you once  
you have dropped a coin into the hat. Because  
the cloying mountain of minds  
  
presses in, because of frailty.  
Because the airy mind is frail. The street-musician  
says, "Examine your pride,  
examine yourself—I am not the government."  
  
You say, "To my mind, I have not gone enough   
to concerts, to enough bars to enough  
of those corners necessary to shake  
the follow and the following."  
  
"The mind and the air  
need each other," he counters,  
"as governance slides from stone  
to brick. Look outside—idylls and fanfares  
  
have blended into a bath-warm middle—you  
are being followed and, I suspect, learning  
about how the mind of an entertainer  
functions. That that hive  
is no government of stone."
