Because some of them crawled on broken

 hands and knees to save me

 with their poems.

  

 Because I was only

 wretchedness at the edge of an abyss

 of fashion magazines, and that

  

 trickle of water down the side of their mountain

 into my empty cup, which I refused to drink, they

 were offering that to me.  Because

  

 I washed my face in their blood.  Because

 I tossed my hours in their coffins.

 Because I was otherwise just dust rising off

 a lampshade.  My

 tatters in rags without them:

  

 A girl blinded by her own hair

 riding her bike somewhere—

 stupid, dying

 for want of what

 was written there.

  

 A glittering starvation, forgiven.  Willing

 to burn their hands for me

 to deliver it, burning

 while I denied that it was burning.

  

 I was like a child outside a cave of snow

 that had collapsed on her fathers.

 I laughed, wildly, for a little while.

  

 And then I screamed.

  

 And then I pouted.

  

 Then I grew older, and had to begin

 to dig my own pitiful little

 hole with a teaspoon to get to them.
