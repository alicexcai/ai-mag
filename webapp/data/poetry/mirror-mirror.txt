Upon a time,

 thin black stalks meet the slope

 turn into

                            a lean boar 

                           runs into pine

                            hide hide hide

                            the hunters drop red coals

                            will cut shaft in heart vine

                            a needle hole

                            for tapestry            

                                            embroidery

                                            pressed against the wall

                                            since century thirteen

 olive grove infested with strange worms

 unpleasant, expressing

                            discord, plucked, shaved, sanctified

                            by Murasaki, beloved of Genji

                            Murasaki who knows the turn

                            of a dull knife

                            who knows the ill luck of the tide

                            kamikaze wind blots

                            port

 O is the yaw O is the yaw

 which is open O is the bowl

 which is open and which will put

 O is the jaw which will put and out

 will spill

                            ears. They look nothing like the ocean.

                            In memory of Sindbad:

                            the steel bite beats

                            around aft yellow

 cannonballs ping hollow

 floorboards the adam

 apple slides over

 cut glass and peels

                            Adonis with premature wrinkles. Time to take

                            the epigraph? No, there is a lake

                            yet, lotus bending over reflection

 maps across landmass. Shoreline 

 more complex upon closer inspection

 is a fractal to follow is twine

 linking cheek to cheek will meet

 at nose. Treasure trove of Atlantis

 hidden at the keel.

                            Call tort

 the Queen’s strong men

 witches brew and bad stepmother

 the golden hen

 forgotten brother

 had been wronged

 prosecution stand behind the tooth

 tongue and court

 fore, aft, head, heel

 it’s cracked

                            but cured by pumice and lime

                            a slick volcano does smooth

                            lines cut fissures make no mark

                            but imprints in ash the last

                            amphoras 

 Coast of Sicily 

 siren sets up keen incessant

 keening spiral through

 a plane

 which meets 

 filigree frame

 at ninety degree bend

                            Once upon a time,

                            again gold, again young, again

                            twelve princesses spiral underground

                            feet by feet wearing shoes

                            for dancing the tambourin

                            follow reed across lake

                            follow whisper of worms

                            lost their way lost their men

                            no good anyhow

                            each sister the face of

                            another

                            each eye its own color

                            each eye its own specter 

                            drops from the vine

                            never found

                            blinks black in dark

                            the end
