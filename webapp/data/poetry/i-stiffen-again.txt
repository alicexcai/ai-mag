I stiffen: again a shift,

 a shuffle somewhere

 in the darkness,

 impenetrable

 as the guillotine.

 The scaffold collapses

 into a bulging jaw

 sputtering against

 the shut. The heart

 is a muscle. Alone,

 against the drawbridge,

 my hand, wet with fog,

 slicks over the steel,

 and the big bolts

 resisting rust. Lift,

 and the rain

 folds like hands retiring

 into applause, and

 your silhouette disappears

 like a question

 into a question mark.

 As if anyone could be

 lost, and permanently.

 A candle spills through

 its wax, as the buildings,

 slowly, fall into a cloud

 which appeared as if

 to catch them, but, in

 truth, held nothing.
