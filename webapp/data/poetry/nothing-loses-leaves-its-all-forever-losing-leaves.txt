A splitting tree stands wind-shook by

 the slender trees swaying lost branches

 scarred low on their sides, stands

  

 lately deciduous, weighted thin

 with first fall. Along Sha Wan Drive

 towards the pool the yellow oleander

  

 flowered like wet tissue ceaselessly

 like paper rain, the grained cement

 the yellow, yellow oxidizing white

  

 the dogs you’d muzzle not to let them

 have a taste. My mother takes us

 to the pool, it’s maybe June, canary

  

 petals landing on our heads, my sister

 small enough she wears my t-shirt

 for a dress, the cinder is so slick

  

 with petaled rot—it used to seem at least

 a life so deadly might not ever die—

 my mother catches a heel, falls

  

 she sends us both ahead to wait for her

 thirteen years ago up past the trees.

 If we could be there still perhaps

  

 I’d run to her, kneel in the dappled light

 piece the foot together from concrete

 although we are each different women now.

  

 Up here the whitened apples nod on trees;

 shrubs waste to burgundy anemone in snow.

 All that grows leaves is breaking

  

 all splits at root. Some mends. I’ll watch

 those slim arms birth entire skies of buds.

 Behind me at the gate in the warm rot

  

 my mother, foot stuck in a gutter, stands

 and all her pain is yellow blooms.
