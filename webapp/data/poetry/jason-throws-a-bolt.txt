Ten men  
on the  
side of a moun  
tain  
dog trying  
to make  
a date  
white snails  
desperately  
clinging to  
the side  
of the  
land.  
Jason  
picking  
brown  
trees – No,  
flowery  
funky  
brown  
daisies  
all the  
walkers  
in natural  
tones  
no neon  

peach  
sky  
blue  
sea  
so what  
approximation  
a poem  
from Greece  
Apollo’s  
legs on  
fat &  
far. Com  
municate  
that  
to a dog.  
5 boats!  
dog road  
trimming  
a mountain  
of black  
wormy  
negotiation  
plunging  
to the  
sea. There’s  
the wifi  
that funny  
bird  
write  
tonight  
I’m that  
part  
of nature  
that doesn’t  
know  
it so  
well. Leave  
it to  
men. Picking  
things. I  
love breeze  
Nature is  
big & I  
feel scrawny  
Dog 3 boats  
Mountain  
blocking  
two.
