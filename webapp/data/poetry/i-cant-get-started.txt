I made a playlist of songs I’d heard in Heaven \
mostly to procrastinate the letters of rec due soon \
the notes to thank Saeed and Deborah an intro \
to a talk the announcement of the talk and a talk \
itself though not the talk I’m talking about a \
different talk. Homeless is the heart, I’d call it. \
The talk I’ve yet to write and yet to talk. \
Uncertain is the mind. I remember a time I had \
no desk to clutter, no meals and no regular address. \
Just the crushed can car I slept in. A town so small \
a wind had nothing to scatter when it blew through. \
I parked myself on the farthest side of the levee, \
away from homes and watched the river riffle \
slowly over cowbelly silt. Listened for scaups \
or cops on patrol. The music of Heaven so far \
away. The sounds of earth are hard to find and \
harder still to catalog. A hard field amplifies each \
hornet. A woman I knew not well but well enough \
she considered me a last resort, someone to escort \
her to a movie down in Sac. I had no cents even. \
Scraped the last of it out of the glovebox to buy \
cigarettes. So I declined. And every whisper being \
overheard, in turn another woman asked how come \
I’d turned the first one down. Then gave me a ten. \
Oh, but I can’t, I said, I can’t pay this back, I have \
no job and don’t know when…but don’t you under \
stand, she said, when someone just wants to give. \
She gave me such a look. And a stick of gum. \
This is the thank you note I haven’t written. \
This is the talk I have yet to give some future \
me, a scattered kid. I’ll name it after a song by Diz.
