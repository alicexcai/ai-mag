The square opens like a screen,

 touching it,

 how it’s a hand and a pattern clears. 

  

 The morning is some hands in front of

 finishing at the time of light

  

 this is because a pattern makes it not happen.

 There is no light against the panes they abstract

 and stay, you touched

  

 your knee as if you are saying

 anything else.  The monument

 where a boy set himself

  

 on fire and put an image

 in his throat,

  

 this is true because you are doing all of it, like his hand

 clearing or an icon which is fissive.
