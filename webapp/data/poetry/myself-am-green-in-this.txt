Myself am green in this:

 the moon let some light

 intensely on the grass.

 The knots on the trunk would make a face on it,

 if one were further in.

 When clouds, the moonâ€™s amok,

 becomes less relevant,

 and cannot hold much.

 What I think of is how,

 when the light is switched off,

 the last thing seen (a lamp)

 flashes on your eyelids.

 What I want is a chair to sit,

 of which I am very certain.
