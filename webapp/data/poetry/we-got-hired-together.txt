My best friend since second grade.  
Same diner, same schedules, same uniforms, same day.  

This friend, I used to boss her around (“You be the sick  
one now.  
Get on the ground and pretend you’re to vomit.”  
I’d draw  
on her face  
with Magic Marker while I held her by a pigtail  
while she begged me to stop. Which I didn’t  

until she had a face full stripes and stars and pox  
and names of boys she liked and boys she hated and  
the rides at the amusement park was afraid to go on.  
Rolling Thunder. Tower of Screams.  
A diner. Her  

single mother told her she needed  
to make some money and no one cared how she made it.  
My parents told me that if I ever planned  
to find out if I was any good at anything  
I’d better start trying  
to find out now. They  

had no idea what a list I had of things I knew I could do  
better than anyone else. These things had to do  
with stealing clothes—from  

anywhere: locker rooms, department stores, friends. And  
a few other things for which the word  
*entrepreneurial* had surely been invented, although  
I hadn’t heard it yet, and even if I’d known  
the word and told them what I could trade  
between classes  
in the staircase  
for cash from the middle hollowed-out book, they  
wouldn’t have been impressed.  
“Get a job,” they said.  

And, yes. Just  
as they’d known I would, I learned  
everything I’d ever need to know about the thing  
I was best at then. And  

so did my friend.  
She’d pass me with a tray in her hands and a French  
fry in her mouth. My  

friend, the weak sister in my fairytale, in her uniform. Which  
was mine as well. Something  
pink and short, which she  
turned it into the centerfold  
of a Playboy magazine  
without needing  
to take it off, with no need  
for nudity or pornography or four staples down its center, no  
glossy paper. She  

just walked over, wearing it, to some guy, and spilled coffee  
on him, and  
he laughed. She got a rag. She  
blotted him up all over before she brought him  
another cup of coffee and his burnt toast—and  

oh my God, her tips. At  
the end of every shift. She crammed the wad of soft bills  
in her purse along  
with the cloudy weight  
of all those quarters  
and heft the strap of it over her shoulder.  

I learned  
how cold the walk-in refrigerator, where  
the ice cream dreamed in the dark could be. No  
hurry. We  

could dream in there forever, those  
frozen tubs, and me. I learned  

how it felt to be  
solid, and then to thaw, and then  
to be consumed, and then—  

how hot it was in the kitchen. I  
could linger there, being  
splattered with those scalding micro-  
droplets of grease blown  
off the grill by the breeze  
of a short-order cook’s sneeze. Never  

once did I say, *Ouch.* But, as if I had, how  

many times an hour  
the kitchen staff would say to me, *Get  
the hell out of here  
if you can’t handle the kitchen.*  

I learned  
that if I stared  
out of the window  
of a diner at night, I  
could see straight through myself, and I  
was a shadow  
waiting to happen.  
On the other side of me  
there was a salad bar. The lettuce  

had already browned around the edges. I  
was the one who had to toss  
those pale leaves around until  
the browned ones were on the bottom. And  

it was my job to refill the chilled ceramic thing  
that held the shredded cheese. *She*  
wasn’t going to do it.  

Or in the window, looking  
at myself in it, I could see not only  
the salad bar behind me, but  

the salad bar inside of me, which  
stretched into the distance for a million miles  
or years, with  
its bowls of coleslaw  
and it plastic squeezer-bottles  
half-full of orange salad dressing. It  

was lined up in the past and in the future, like  
years of insomnia—my  
ancestors’ insomnia, and the insomnia of my children’s  
children’s children, all  
of us waiting for generations, not  
so much for sleep, but for a shift  
in the whole idea  
of sleep would, for the day when sleep would be recalled  
as quaint, and sad. That  
salad bar suggested I might be  
the first living creature on Earth  

who wouldn’t need it.  

I learned that.  

And when the manager  
brought us together said  
that one of us had to go, I nodded as  
I’d seen my father  
nod his head. I cast  
my eyes down to the floor  
the way my mother did  
when she picked up the phone and someone asked her a question  
to which she had no answer. “I sure  

wish I could turn the two of you  
into one girl and keep  
you both,” said. Clerical  

work, to me, he suggested. I left  

my uniform on a hanger in the bathroom.  
Before I left, my friend  
ran into my arms, sobbing—or  
at least pretending to sob. “I  

personally thought you were  
wonderful,” she said, “at your job,” in  

a way that made me  
want to die.  
That night  

I tried to kill myself  
by swallowing an aspirin  
without water. But it slid  

right past my tongue, down my throat.  
I was relieved.  
I wanted to live. There would be  

brownish oceans  
in my future, with brownish waves  
washing up  
on shores. There was  

the purity of wolves devouring  
the purity of rabbits. And  

birds to scribble  
all over the sky. Also  
bored children and dense thickets, full  

of a thousand members  
of an audience  
standing up and clapping  
for a band.  

Concert finally over. Everyone  
deaf, dazed, just  
wanting to get out of there, go home, wishing  
they’d never come.  
I’d be one of them. But  

I’d wait in my seat until the rest had left. Then  
I’d see  
the lead singer  
(too famous to be named) come  
back on stage to find  
a guitar pick he had dropped. He’d  
scowl and wave at me, friendly  
and full of hatred. I smiled  
and shook my head, which  

seemed to startle him. He said, “It  
sucked.” He said, “We suck. But  
at least we know it, don’t we?”  

My reply: it  
was perfect. It  

changed both our lives. We’d  

go on together, forever, and never  
need to speak again. We  

knew what we did best, both of us, after that, and  
we’d do that, exactly—although  

in order for you to believe me  
I must never tell you what I said.
