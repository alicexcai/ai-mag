Far back before the sun  
made any sort of difference,  
and the icicles hung like knots  
in the light-grains that housed us,

I was unafraid to take your hand,  
unaware of the future we unzipped  
like a winter coat in late March,  
thinking not so much I was touching you,

but somehow touch, and thus entering  
some kind of experience. But it was remarkably  
just like any other object, for something  
with so many nerve endings.

Even your eyes, glowing in the halo  
the sun praises from the atmosphere  
in a still and timeless ring of dawnanddusk,  
spin through it like a pair of fading globes.
