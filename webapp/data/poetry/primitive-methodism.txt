  Driving interstate 81 by Frackville

 you might notice the long lines in the rock

 on the flat walls to your right, those lines,

 you might ask me, what are those lines?

 I’d have to explain how they drill these

 veins into the rock, how they fill these

 rocks with dynamite, how they will these

 mountains into molehills and brush them

 off their coats God bless the borough of

 Frackville God bless Schuylkill county.

  

 My great grandfather made those lines

 sitting at his desk with pencils with no

 erasers eating sauerkraut and potatoes

 in a place that prided itself on not being

 undermined God bless the borough of

 Frackville God bless Schuylkill county.

  

 I have come here to take credit for this-

 look his math stands correct forever in rock-

 proceed without caution ungrateful out of staters.

 I have come here to take credit for every bid

 in pinochle, son who learned to park six inches

 from the curb, line of dynamite that went right.

 I have come here to take credit if you would

 look around you and see the world he has 

 built and thank me for he is not here now.  

 I have come here to take what is due to one

 who like anthracite has been sunk buried

 pressed to make fuel like grapes to wine.

 I have come here to be Dionysus with vine in

 one hand coal in the other and you maenad

 follow me into this mine like a mangy mule.

 I have come here to show you the bottom of

 the mine which mules do not leave until shot

 which my family left three generations ago.

 I have come riding on a mule today with my

 great grandfather walking it as an American

 nativity pageant heading for Philadelphia.

 I have his life insurance evaluation his calipers

 from Frackville Service Equipment Corporation

 his Pottsville Explosive comb case to show you.

 I will show you no more, for you need to look for

 his autograph. God bless the borough of

 Frackville God bless Schuylkill county.
