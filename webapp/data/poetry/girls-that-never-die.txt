in the kingdom of purity i obeyed my husband  
i walked behind him my breasts covered  

by a camera &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in his arms was a mirror held aloft  
i faced myself & myself blurred in slightest motion  

light fleeing the shutter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; & in the castle of purity  
i closed the lights & faced my husband & my husband  

called me by my glottal name &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my mouth  
a depression in clay &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my mouth a mirror in the arms  

of my husband &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my minaret a nipple in the direction  
of my husband & five times a day i hesitate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; & five  

times a day i chip a tooth & study sepia photographs  
to learn names for my mothers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to learn arrangements  

for my photographed parts &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my captured parts  
i tighten the frame &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i close my legs  

when i say girlhood i say prison  
i clean myself up & repent
