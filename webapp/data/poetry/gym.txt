*after Robert Pinsky and Heather Christle*

  

  

 The trainer   the client   the desk clerk   the screen

 the cell phone talker   the Lulu lemon   the camel toe cardio

    the old money type

 the stud with the guns and the dark Lycra mock

 the stay-at-home mom who just comes to be touched

 The bench in the back and the stopwatch at click

 the now two more   now two more   featherlight chide

  

 This V-shaped trainer was walking toward me   the space

 between the leg press and the abs was narrow but not

 that narrow   Never very good at things like gyms or

 people   and I was walking toward him too   I was

 like *When is he going to give some room?   I need room too*   I was

 like *Dude go bathe your dogs*   in my head

  

 The doctor   the cyclist   the free weights   the gotchya

 Mr. Universe   Mr. Platitude   Mr. Screenplay-Always-At-Ready-

    in-Pocket

 Smug middle-aged and the kid companion   the Here-To-Be-Ogled

    the Let’s-Make-A-Deal

 maybe does a set or two but mostly reads the magazines

 The plates   the bells   the lighting   the fees

 the flooring   the spacing   the exit   the rest of us
