*for Allison*  

All lovers feel like they’re inventing  
something. How else would we work  
out the kinks? I am in awe of your  
pussy. You said it appears like I am  
doing an inspection. True. True.  
I lift the hood. I study your anatomy  
of flowers and fruit. Mixing food with  
sex disgusts you. You hate cantaloupe  
and the texture of cherries. Once, you  
had a nightmare about being force-fed  
grapes.  Your eyes change colors when  
you laugh. There goes the secret life of  
green, witch hazel spells of black magic.  
You encourage me to *keep climbing* as I,  
a heathen hymn, teach you the taxonomy  
of touch. You, a table of plenty, show me  
how to paint by numbers. One is never  
enough. Two: my lips at your neck. Another  
two: the sound of my name—twin flame  
of your own. Four: your hands around my  
ankles. I present you with pansies and lilac.  
This poem is a form of praise and worship.  
In years lived, you’re on page twenty-eight,  
and I on page thirty-two. I hope that you  
survive me, I do not ever want to go without.
