In my dream the old woman had a ribbon for the boy  
  
and the ribbon had a message.  What to make  
  
of this.  That the woman I dreamed of had a penis  
  
on her knee she could find no one to hold.  
  
That the man who is central plays guitar  
   
and all he wants is to be loved.

 

I seemed to be that man whose death is his security,  
  
whose stony head will model stony crown.  
  
Who turns away predators with assiduity  
  
dips his head to swallow wide  
   
reflections in the body.

 

The brain’s a map that’s flat.  
  
Don’t expect to feel the incision.  
  
Nerves don’t end there.
