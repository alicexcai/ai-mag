See, that’s the thing you’re not getting, the part \
about the gods, or whatever you want \
to call what happens in the world…or doesn’t\
…or not as you had hoped\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—that if my wish\
for more direct or full attention, like \
a shout against all odds reaching the stage, \
is heard, I’ll be wishing just as plainly \
through the wreckage that it hadn’t been:\
a mirror, safe enough at a distance, \
has drawn you close—to tweeze, maybe, to pick \
at some less than radiant patch of skin\
—and you find yourself, later, unable \
to pull away.  Looking not _at_ your face \
anymore, but _through_ to what, earlier, \
you must have missed: like a burst of starlings, \
the shape they make against an open sky: \
regret, fierce and no longer contained by \
some previously agreed-upon boundary. \
For them, it’s like a game—_I’ll look away_ 



_if you do_, you tell them, \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you tell them back.
