When I pulled that great fish up out of Lake Skinner’s  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mirrored-double surface, I wanted to release  
the tugging beast immediately. Disaster on the rod,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it seemed he might yank the whole aluminum skiff  
down toward the bottom of his breathless world.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old tree of a man yelled to hang on and would  
not help me as I reeled and reeled finally seeing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the black carp come up to meet me, black eye to black eye.  
In the white cooler it looked so impossible.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this where I am supposed to apologize? Not  
only to the fish, but to the whole lake, land, not only for me  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but for the generations of plunder and vanish.  
I remember his terrible mouth opening as if to swallow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the barbarous girl he’d lose his life to. That gold-ringed  
eye did not pardon me, no absolution, no reprieve.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to catch something; it wanted to live.  
We never ate the bottom-feeder, buried by the rose bush  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where my ancestors swore the roses bloomed  
twice as big that year, the year I killed a thing because  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told to, the year I met my twin and buried  
him without weeping so I could be called brave.
