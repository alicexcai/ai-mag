To protect a vegetable garden

 from rabbits

 you must lay the chicken wire

 twenty-five centimeters

 into the soil.

 They can’t dig that deep.

 Eighteen meters of wire fencing,

 four sides of four and a half,

 iron stakes cornering the square,

 entrusted with strawberries, tomatoes,

 artichoke hearts.

 The farm was near Biarritz.

 Our hunter green tablecloth unfurled

 labyrinthine corridors of blueberry bushes

 winding down into the River Nive

 sailing blueberry flotsam

 through piment d’Espelette villages

 into the Atlantic.

 The Carcelles had owned Xixtaberri

 for seven years.

 This summer

 I was their only guest.

 I worked for room and board.

 In July, at dinner,

 they told me how

 in March, at night,

 they had lost their child. How

 in the morning, his crib was just

 empty, its narrow wooden slats

 painting strips of sunlight

 on the hardwood floor.

 A rabbit

 can slip through an opening

 of five centimeters,

 said Noël, his legs dangling

 in the corn husks below the porch,

 drinking one glass of sambuca Ramazzotti

 on ice, like every other night.

 He stared into its milky white

 snow globe murk before each sip.

 He told me he once trapped rabbits

 and snapped their necks

 but that he didn’t use live traps

 anymore. I found one in the bushes,

 an ancient and empty cage,

 and he slipped his fingers

 into his trap’s square lattice,

 two centimeters by two centimeters,

 white knuckles clinging

 to rusted memory.

 If there was one,

 there must have been others,

 entangled and forgotten in blueberry folds –

 and he cried to imagine it – clawing paws,

 pawing hands, unable to know

 what is happening
