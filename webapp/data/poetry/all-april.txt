We stayed inside \
and drew red trains

we ate burritos \
like it was the end

the air was sweeter \
for a good long while

everything had stopped \
so many people we know

lost so much so fast \
so many others

did not come and sit \
near our door and say

how is your garden \
your little sunflowers

they say are simple \
to grow in a line

it is said their heads \
turn to watch the sun

but they donâ€™t at all \
no birds ever came

to eat the green shoots \
my little sunflowers

I watched them poke up \
through the soft black dirt

with that undeserved pride \
I feel when he writes his name

I did not teach him guitar \
like I was my dad

I just put him in the car \
and played Guided by Voices

and drove back and forth \
through his favorite tunnel

it got dark and light \
then so dark again
