The party was impenetrably  
loud and in motion.  

A while later, the rooms thinned.  
It started to snow. A train  

roared past like a redaction.  
The great writer played his stereo low,  

and I sat on the couch  
between two aging professors  

and pretended to know who he was playing.  
It became clear to me  

he was as weak and terrified as anyone.  
When it was just the two of us,  

he took down some brandy  
and offered the spare room. Now wind  

drags over this house  
he must have left while I was sleeping—  

where I’ve woken to find myself alone  
with all his things.
