The spud keyed up the ice

 like Tec was trying to chip

 flakes into his lemonade.

 That’s pretty fucking deep

 right there, he massaged

 from cheeks taut

 with the cracked

 shake of trees

 unchewed: not much

 but jagged beeches,

 stretching their necks

 against the settling

 cut of cold.

  

 He stepped slow

 through the flat snow,

 enough to cover the leaded gouge

 of the spud.

  

 Gotta cut some poles,

 he said, kicking a clean chew astray.

 That’s a big house.

 He fingered the painted hatchet.

  

 His hole echoed across the

 whited bog—long enough to get

 the dead-spruce poles down,

 wide enough to get

 a fifty pounder up. Diving

 his hand and wrist and arm

 into the black,

 it came back crystalized.

  

 Right there—that’s the channel to

 the feed bed over there,

 a snapped stick lump

 large enough for four.

  

 Tec pinched the springs in place,

 strapped those to the poles.

 Using a three-thirty here,

 a blind set here.

 Tec rapped on smiling

 green splint sticks

 in his oiled pack basket.

 This here popple

 is candy to them.

 He wired a chunk

 to the wiley trigger.

  

 The ice moaned deep and low,

 the pins, the masses

 leaned in, stared.

  

 Tec sets the toothless jaw wide,

 a gummy smile of rust,

 it slips into the water,

 nestles aside the muck.
