We burn the rings. We burn the hummocks threaded up  
 from sand back down to it. We knit their manyed  
 peaks into the flame, a fire beating from our hands.   
 Its fingered blades. The isthmic strands we grip  
 that weave the hummock in. From heartring   
 dead. From younger rings that age in lockstep  
 round, proceeding. Radiate: the mice twitch   
 burrow into run. The smoke unfurls its plane.   
 The fires constellate, and lifting, dredge  
 those yawning pupils open on the sand.   
  
spinifex ring  
 The one to one that touches in its bright makes many   
 scurrying out to scent what good direction. To unspool  
 out the hum. The hummock’s rustle frays the strains  
 each pulsebeat measures. Each hurries from  
 that feathered mouth that hisses as it preens.   no   
 no  very bad and blooming  the sky gluts thick  
 and drops.  The what for whom sheer wanting sprouts  
 its limbs, appends and swells the objects in its reach.   
 It rises them. The hummock bursting upwards   
 by that bright, then bustles, shines and caves. The  far  
 and farther till the air sinks up.  The shadows   
 planted down await their fated objects in the clearing.

 *Note:  Spinifex is a grass that grows in hummucks in Australia. When the hummock ages, its inner circle collapses, resulting in a ring.*
