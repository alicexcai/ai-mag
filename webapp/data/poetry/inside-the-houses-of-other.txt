He is Blot

 it is a name

 and down the street

 he walks with

 his name to a

 house of timber

 frame with a door

 of mirrored glass

 that he raps.

 The quavering pane

 buzzes Blot’s reflected

 edges turning

 temporarily to mud.

 Highest definition

 of self then resurrected

 an aquiline vision comes

 twinkling out of the

 stiff staring well at

 the front of the house

 by the corded bell

 he didn’t notice.

 His body is many

 predated little creatures

 he tracks—each

 he knows and smiles at

 from flight high

 over this mirror

 his empyrean head

 lofts always over

 every mirror welling

 like quicksilver kettle

 holes one after another

 sending back Blot

 tilting his shades

 or Frenching a smoke

 or Blot naked

 admiring the quilled

 vasculature of his

 mammalian wings.

 The bird of prey

 surveying its own

 body is the child

 Moses fondling rushes

 tufting by the bend

 awaiting the one

 who will take to him

 the architect’s own concept

 and relish the saw work

 the sanding and the

 double coat. Blot

 craves only an eye

 a Cyclops all head

 and no body. The

 mirror swings suddenly

 inward and the

 frame blinks a black

 lid ruptured by

 a silver shooting

 pit bull gnashing

 artifice to spark

 Blot hauled like metal

 hanging from a bus’s

 underside to the curb

 and left possumed in

 the dark rush of cars

 no taller than bolted

 hubs inch-near

 in passing
