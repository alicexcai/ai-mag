&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stranger, uninvited, you  
come up to us on the sidewalk,  

my daughter’s hand in mine, you  
look at her &  

coo, *It goes so fast.* What, stranger,  
is this unnamed *it*—this day?  

her life? our  

happiness? Stranger, maybe you  
missed it, but just now  

my daughter & I hurled  

rocks into the emptiness  
& we created more  

emptiness.
