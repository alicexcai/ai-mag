I hide in the family woods and  
wait for it.  
Brother and Sister,  
Ask and Embla come

to the edge.  
 I was born from driftwood.  
I made myself  
 a thrush— 

 the song is smoke over the fire now.  
Aspens are charred limbs.  
 They are abstract.  
 Brother and Sister set this 

 I hold the veiny leaves  
 falling blackened to the dirt.  
 Impress them in my palm they come apart.  
The trees contort 

 from heat, they  
 groan—the branches scribble furiously and  
I am separated  
 in the burning. Plumes float over. 

 Now I recover form.  
 I walk the limbs and am forever forgetting  
what was my name  
Life or zest or Leaf or Lifprasir

 

what was my detail-soaked skin—  
Not this  
 the convulsion didn’t save the other  
half of things. 

 What was here  
 before they came through the unveiled sex of  
the sky and left fire  
 for small things? 

 Ask and Embla,  
 Brother and Sister made  
 a perfect forest.  
 It is perfect. I remember my limb.
