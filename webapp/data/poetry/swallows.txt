Shards of exact memory, 

 masters of local 

 magnitude, keepers 

 of untranslating

 logic where

 eternity is 

 a wandering here — 

 these twining parallel 

 blindnesses 

 in future-outpacing 

 angles spelling 

 disintegration 

 of great intelligence: 

 carefullest madness, 

 black on blue, 

 black on clear, memory 

 everywhere proving 

 life whose will 

 still they scrawl still 

 they carve this easiest 

 element with fleet 

 illegibles 

 in circleshaming

 precision — bright-black

 eyes — and 

 at evening by

 the cathedral rouse 

 thick air as if 

 around vanished 

 scaffoldings and night 

 expands the gaps

 they are: lost 

 arrows halftracing 

 a sphere: all clockwise: 

 yet some hover: 

 yet some wander 

 over what border: 

 and hourly unities 

 inarguable as breath 

 shift the frame, smooth 

 the canvas: here

 an absent entirety 

 flickers: will they 

 sing
