sestina of the missile jfk,"
You skitter mad,

 Jack,

 misguided ballistic

 with a lazy left eye and your high-pitched

 whine of a fuselage dripping

 coolant immediately crystalline to leave your flicker-

  

 trail in the stratosphere. We watch you flicker

 by again across our televisions tonight, nomad-

 ic the way we could never be boxing up our palace of refrigerated paint-drips.

 Here on the couch we commune with you, Jack,

 you blockhead, in thinking there is more than adamantine space garbage in the pitch-

 black, and going ballistic

  

 among the weird, ancient, stars and ballistic

 vibrations of the kinds of true science we flick

 through at breakfast, in magazines, trying to figure the evolutionary origin of teeth. Pitch

 us another perfect white orb, drive us just mad

 enough for the American past-time of jack-

 hammering detritus and patenting the feeling like the flotsam-feeders we are, dripping

  

 with pride like the crackle-pop of your cassette tape voice box which, yet unfinished, drips

 school glue at the slightest oscillation. Perhaps, then, it is for the best that the intercontinental ballistic

 missiles went unfired, although they were undeniably shaped like lightning bolts, you genius, jack-

 booted thug. One flick

 of a switch would have made uranium boom towns of all our vacant lots and cataclysmic mad-

 houses for our traveling salesmen pitching

  

 themselves asunder, who now, door-to-door, sing slightly off-pitch

 and only of you. And so drippily

 we venerate the one who, barreling upward, kept us safe, like the one who made

 glow-in-the-dark, the one who made stars. And so though the ballistic

 reports came back conclusive the thought might have flickered

 quietly across the Midwest like the seconds before snow that you would come back, Jack.

  

 Jack,

 our idiot savior, for whom we flock to where cities fall dark as pitch,

 where constellations flicker

 most conspiratorial. Come morning, we will read the greatest story ever told on cereal boxes, dripping

 milk from our chins because *ballistic*

 means moving under the force of gravity only. You skitter mad,

  

 Jack, throw us a wink. Drip

 us another pitch, plans for a new kind of ballistic

 to a new shape of moon, and we will flicker to you, madly.

the natural,"
The natural street-musician will follow you once  
you have dropped a coin into the hat. Because  
the cloying mountain of minds  
  
presses in, because of frailty.  
Because the airy mind is frail. The street-musician  
says, ""Examine your pride,  
examine yourself—I am not the government.""  
  
You say, ""To my mind, I have not gone enough   
to concerts, to enough bars to enough  
of those corners necessary to shake  
the follow and the following.""  
  
""The mind and the air  
need each other,"" he counters,  
""as governance slides from stone  
to brick. Look outside—idylls and fanfares  
  
have blended into a bath-warm middle—you  
are being followed and, I suspect, learning  
about how the mind of an entertainer  
functions. That that hive  
is no government of stone.""

and the army ants’ prey.  
peculiar though, this erasure—  
with wider aperture

footprints are removed  
and yet remain overhead

a suspension—

This collection of torches convulsing in ink: 

 it is not what I wanted to give you.

 All whites look older at night and yet 

 the tapestry has to include them… 

 I wanted you to sip this one swatch of light

 that stands singly, and 

 the tan peasant wind that catches and fans  

 the thin milk of its undergarment, and 

 how morning blood un-hasps 

 the hatches behind sleep’s cogs, flooding

 and the blasted furnace that risks ecstasis 

 according to…* Is this truly the color of my hands?* 

 I wanted to give you the searing first glance

 again, wanted you to grab and fold

 into that one swatch of cloth 

 and stay and raise your hands 

 and your children’s hands later when  

 I melt into cadenza and we waft hoarsily past these

 pinewood rafters, records of starlings—then

 till chance is at last served raw to stirring gods,

 till I can’t name the scent of any ripeness

 and no longer know what cool water means,

 I will needle my eyes into  

 the position of afterstars. I will make 

 light trip and sift off sandstone in  

 the quarries. We have witnessed

 too many rutilant past tenses.  

 Now I shall be the saver of pauses.

 We will need breath later.

 We erred. Sky should be easier.  

 I thought this would be different, this looking up. 

 I thought there would be a granary.

 Or, if you are not the type

 not to complain to the neighbors

 The Pisces.

 seemed afraid of nothing, listened

 to music too loud

  

 and to no advice.

  

 A whole

canonical,"

The party was impenetrably  
loud and in motion.  

A while later, the rooms thinned.  
It started to snow. A train  

roared past like a redaction.  
The great writer played his stereo low,  

and I sat on the couch  
between two aging professors  

and pretended to know who he was playing.  
It became clear to me  

he was as weak and terrified as anyone.  
When it was just the two of us,  

he took down some brandy  
and offered the spare room. Now wind  

drags over this house  
he must have left while I was sleeping—  

where I’ve woken to find myself alone  
with all his things.

I don’t exactly think I will.  
I don’t exactly wish I don’t.  
The science is inexact, and don’t  
Think it won’t splice you  
As you swish by  
On your two-stroke motor  
Scooter with your bright visor  
Held aloft for all to topple.  
Your orbit is unseeming.  
It takes you in, like a market  
Spilling futures  
On the livestock you are  
On the soybeans you aspire to  
And the husks and straws  
Baking your energy  
Into meticulous kitty litter crypto 
Currency in the metabolic  
Cycle you were born for:  
Come and see yourself  
By and by, baby-naked and  
Time-begrimed  
In your coin-op space scope.  
Its azimuth is lacking  
Its optics are exacting  
And can smother  
Grainy eggs of the tiniest  
Horned reptile  
Secreted in the stream bed  
You once took to.  
It might feel like something  
To feel something capturing you 
In milled mirroring lenses  
As you are and would be  
But that self-love is  
Nostalgia.

 Will I eat the rotting apple before me.

 the blank-faced compass, oblique to

 pooling at the chipped carapace

 also chipped, also slow on the cloth.

 Am I obliged of this cluster to pluck

 its briny tubes. Just as in the anatomy

  

 of choice every action need not have will 

 behind it which is to say choice does not 

  

 in the penumbra of utility 

 reveal preference. 

  

 III. 

  

 But I want to engage. Want to tell 

 you all I have learned about will 

  

 in the intervening years.

 vinegar, carve out a face and 

 leave it to dry in the sun.

 Perhaps it will remind me

"
the first fish,"

When I pulled that great fish up out of Lake Skinner’s  
      mirrored-double surface, I wanted to release  
the tugging beast immediately. Disaster on the rod,  
      it seemed he might yank the whole aluminum skiff  
down toward the bottom of his breathless world.  
      The old tree of a man yelled to hang on and would  
not help me as I reeled and reeled finally seeing  
      the black carp come up to meet me, black eye to black eye.  
In the white cooler it looked so impossible.  
      Is this where I am supposed to apologize? Not  
only to the fish, but to the whole lake, land, not only for me  
      but for the generations of plunder and vanish.  
I remember his terrible mouth opening as if to swallow  
      the barbarous girl he’d lose his life to. That gold-ringed  
eye did not pardon me, no absolution, no reprieve.  
      I wanted to catch something; it wanted to live.  
We never ate the bottom-feeder, buried by the rose bush  
      where my ancestors swore the roses bloomed  
twice as big that year, the year I killed a thing because  
      I was told to, the year I met my twin and buried  
him without weeping so I could be called brave.  
"
lovecution,"
Most of the cups in the house are missing a piece.  
Not about handles, about completion.  
Water pooling in a stray’s footprint: bellybutton heat.  
Follow my proof. Faith is the only way to praxis.  
Need more hours in the day.  
Need more stretch of twilight.  
Need more oil for the stop-me-creaking.  
Need to know where the fronds land at the end of a dandelion wish.  
Yesterday I saw a pair of eyes larger than I’d ever seen.  
Today I inherit a million blankets.  
Hold me for as long as you are able: Until even those handholds go droop.  
Until even our front door receives a root canal.  
Until even the first song we danced to becomes the broth.  
Not a chain of superstition, a bouquet.  
"
weighing the difference,"

*with a line from Sappho, translated by William Logan*

<br>
Anna interprets my dreams as the fear of botching  
a chance at heaven. I would like to believe in  
the plurals of things, the hour shored up against a bridge,  
its bright underbelly furring against my cheekbones.  
Everything here is all shutter and no latch.  
We’re a bunch of wackos who cry before our birthdays  
so the morning startles in its fullness. Sappho, from the Greek,  
could haul up a bucket of spring water  
from that reeking sewer of her life.  
Seeing that my life is not so much sewer as the lake  
we swim in, with its fair share of algae and silt blooms,  
the water should be clean enough, if not to drink,  
then to wash away the day’s worth of dirt.  
"
a hawthorn rooted close to other guests,"
This is not

 nature—the way

 pain interrupts

 its answers, ashen

  

 awl-tipped

 limbs waving

 and brushing them-

 selves, chill crushes

  

 carried across

 the ravine; and

 a wing of 

 their broken flutter,

  

 that desiccated

 battle-din, is

 hooked by a frosty

 steam, and it balds.

  

 Though the awls are

 hollow-point—the un-

 graspable locusts

 having left

  

 behind veins of shadowy

 larvae inside them.

 And the hollowed-out

 scent of cold rain. And

  

 suddenly—a corridor

 of ropy light

 twines round

 the stems and

  

 fills those absent

 bodies with steamy

 voices they cannot

 share, cannot

  

 reveal, retaining

 a skin that shields

 unerringly—And so

 the sudden remains

  

 only as an answer

 the stilled silk

 flowers

 prod-up to reach

  

 on this dog’s grave

 (what symmetry

 can gather itself

 entire, in the

  

 open air?)—a calm

 tended to by

 the wrinkled spines of

 shucked chestnuts.

  

 I would invoke

 the radiance of the mirror

 uncovering itself

 inside the glistering

 the receding waves of

 these flowers, fathering

 the dusk into them.

south pole station,"
        “There is no darkness

seen the sun in months, it being winter.  
You thought about it once and couldn’t  
stop, calculating volumes, investigating  
temperatures of surface and depth.  
You don’t remember depth.  You don’t remember  
color, you spent days searching for a lamp  
the color of the sun.  
The sun is not a color but a disk  
whose wavelength resonates your skin.

Plato mistook the good for the sun,  
that day in Amsterdam the clouds parted,  
you leapt up from the war memorial and  
the world had been given back  
finally.  You heard of people lost their eyes this way.  
  


"
i cant get started,"
I made a playlist of songs I’d heard in Heaven \
mostly to procrastinate the letters of rec due soon \
the notes to thank Saeed and Deborah an intro \
to a talk the announcement of the talk and a talk \
itself though not the talk I’m talking about a \
different talk. Homeless is the heart, I’d call it. \
The talk I’ve yet to write and yet to talk. \
Uncertain is the mind. I remember a time I had \
no desk to clutter, no meals and no regular address. \
Just the crushed can car I slept in. A town so small \
a wind had nothing to scatter when it blew through. \
I parked myself on the farthest side of the levee, \
away from homes and watched the river riffle \
slowly over cowbelly silt. Listened for scaups \
or cops on patrol. The music of Heaven so far \
away. The sounds of earth are hard to find and \
harder still to catalog. A hard field amplifies each \
hornet. A woman I knew not well but well enough \
she considered me a last resort, someone to escort \
her to a movie down in Sac. I had no cents even. \
Scraped the last of it out of the glovebox to buy \
cigarettes. So I declined. And every whisper being \
overheard, in turn another woman asked how come \
I’d turned the first one down. Then gave me a ten. \
Oh, but I can’t, I said, I can’t pay this back, I have \
no job and don’t know when…but don’t you under \
stand, she said, when someone just wants to give. \
She gave me such a look. And a stick of gum. \
This is the thank you note I haven’t written. \
This is the talk I have yet to give some future \
me, a scattered kid. I’ll name it after a song by Diz.

ascent,"
Down by the creek

           named for its sweat-

 scented roots, my sister taught me

           to relieve the ache I imagined

 God gave only the wicked. Here

           is where to place

 your touch, your breath, your troubling

           assent. Delight

 relived--the anticipated end

 the appearance of lives

 to call pleasure is more

           akin to belief.) My sister slouched

 over when the soughing

           ceased, said, no one has to know

 this place exists.

           Talking feels canceled when I stand alone  
in the forest. Mother, your thinness is a letter  
to my worry. I watch you work in the garden.  
I confuse solitude with loneliness.  
My hair is also grey kisses at sundown.  
A doe strafes the ridgeline, until lost  
in the thicket, only snapping brush.

   
           God undressed in an arbor of madness;  
I am his mannequin’s shadow.  
My eyes empty the last clip of daylight  
into the forest, and quietly  
the rain on leaves leaves leaves clean.

   
           A son’s no thing but a map to likeness.  
You have tried to make me yours—  
I think of the bones you broke to bring me here.  
I promise, I am trying to love the world.  
Say it is not impossible. Place  
your flowers on the sill inside me.

"
fata morgana,"
 

 one morning you will sense me 

 now, slipping like air

         through your incisors and lower

  

 lip. you might marvel at

 the intrusion soft 

        sound makes, a separation of

  

 flesh and bone for faint

 diffusion. you must find it

        easier to distinguish ocean

  

 from sky when there is mist

 between, the sort that blunts

        the precipice of a stark horizon,

  

 cuts across the seam where air 

 meets water perpendicular,

        curdling light into expanses

  

 of moist blossoms. when day breaks

 you may follow the gulls with

        your vision and find me

  

 adrift. then I shall leave you

 cleft, the way a strait brings 

        a city down to its knees.

  

 then again I might stray,

 hovering forwards, just how a ship

        unmoored floats ashore

we turn, twisting our seatbelts at

uncanny execution acts  
its ancient orchestrations – “there are

the conductor, “that play so beautifully

all blank arpeggiation, bright

cold throw,"
I can come but still I cannot meditate.  
Before these months, when I saw a bathtub,  
I did not dare lie down inside of it,  
knowing I might begin to dream of physical  
cloud and epidermis, and come apart  
as completely as I had dreamed.  
As I had feared. So many sensations.  
But you know, I tried this last night,  
as I went through my meticulous list of  
trying, top to bottom. I lit the expensive  
candle on the windowsill naked in  
my bathroom and admired the stained  
marble, and thought of all the things  
I was afraid to forget, but could not  
know them, nor find reason, and when  
in the morning my mother came in  
exclaiming she smelled the candle,  
I said I did not. For this is how,  
whatever is apparent to you I do not see.  
While the white scented body of wax  
was slow waning there was no pleasant  
smell, or any smell at all, only  
the self in the throat, slowly diminishing.

petal. Now. You were there. Above. You

   
were there. Nazareth is waiting. Nazareth waits  
for no-one. I am still miles behind us, full

   
of wonder, at what palm each pit might become.

"
we got hired together,"

My best friend since second grade.  
Same diner, same schedules, same uniforms, same day.  

This friend, I used to boss her around (“You be the sick  
one now.  
Get on the ground and pretend you’re to vomit.”  
I’d draw  
on her face  
with Magic Marker while I held her by a pigtail  
while she begged me to stop. Which I didn’t  

until she had a face full stripes and stars and pox  
and names of boys she liked and boys she hated and  
the rides at the amusement park was afraid to go on.  
Rolling Thunder. Tower of Screams.  
A diner. Her  

single mother told her she needed  
to make some money and no one cared how she made it.  
My parents told me that if I ever planned  
to find out if I was any good at anything  
I’d better start trying  
to find out now. They  

had no idea what a list I had of things I knew I could do  
better than anyone else. These things had to do  
with stealing clothes—from  

anywhere: locker rooms, department stores, friends. And  
a few other things for which the word  
*entrepreneurial* had surely been invented, although  
I hadn’t heard it yet, and even if I’d known  
the word and told them what I could trade  
between classes  
in the staircase  
for cash from the middle hollowed-out book, they  
wouldn’t have been impressed.  
“Get a job,” they said.  

And, yes. Just  
as they’d known I would, I learned  
everything I’d ever need to know about the thing  
I was best at then. And  

so did my friend.  
She’d pass me with a tray in her hands and a French  
fry in her mouth. My  

friend, the weak sister in my fairytale, in her uniform. Which  
was mine as well. Something  
pink and short, which she  
turned it into the centerfold  
of a Playboy magazine  
without needing  
to take it off, with no need  
for nudity or pornography or four staples down its center, no  
glossy paper. She  

just walked over, wearing it, to some guy, and spilled coffee  
on him, and  
he laughed. She got a rag. She  
blotted him up all over before she brought him  
another cup of coffee and his burnt toast—and  

oh my God, her tips. At  
the end of every shift. She crammed the wad of soft bills  
in her purse along  
with the cloudy weight  
of all those quarters  
and heft the strap of it over her shoulder.  

I learned  
how cold the walk-in refrigerator, where  
the ice cream dreamed in the dark could be. No  
hurry. We  

could dream in there forever, those  
frozen tubs, and me. I learned  

how it felt to be  
solid, and then to thaw, and then  
to be consumed, and then—  

how hot it was in the kitchen. I  
could linger there, being  
splattered with those scalding micro-  
droplets of grease blown  
off the grill by the breeze  
of a short-order cook’s sneeze. Never  

once did I say, *Ouch.* But, as if I had, how  

many times an hour  
the kitchen staff would say to me, *Get  
the hell out of here  
if you can’t handle the kitchen.*  

I learned  
that if I stared  
out of the window  
of a diner at night, I  
could see straight through myself, and I  
was a shadow  
waiting to happen.  
On the other side of me  
there was a salad bar. The lettuce  

had already browned around the edges. I  
was the one who had to toss  
those pale leaves around until  
the browned ones were on the bottom. And  

it was my job to refill the chilled ceramic thing  
that held the shredded cheese. *She*  
wasn’t going to do it.  

Or in the window, looking  
at myself in it, I could see not only  
the salad bar behind me, but  

the salad bar inside of me, which  
stretched into the distance for a million miles  
or years, with  
its bowls of coleslaw  
and it plastic squeezer-bottles  
half-full of orange salad dressing. It  

was lined up in the past and in the future, like  
years of insomnia—my  
ancestors’ insomnia, and the insomnia of my children’s  
children’s children, all  
of us waiting for generations, not  
so much for sleep, but for a shift  
in the whole idea  
of sleep would, for the day when sleep would be recalled  
as quaint, and sad. That  
salad bar suggested I might be  
the first living creature on Earth  

who wouldn’t need it.  

I learned that.  

And when the manager  
brought us together said  
that one of us had to go, I nodded as  
I’d seen my father  
nod his head. I cast  
my eyes down to the floor  
the way my mother did  
when she picked up the phone and someone asked her a question  
to which she had no answer. “I sure  

wish I could turn the two of you  
into one girl and keep  
you both,” said. Clerical  

work, to me, he suggested. I left  

my uniform on a hanger in the bathroom.  
Before I left, my friend  
ran into my arms, sobbing—or  
at least pretending to sob. “I  

personally thought you were  
wonderful,” she said, “at your job,” in  

a way that made me  
want to die.  
That night  

I tried to kill myself  
by swallowing an aspirin  
without water. But it slid  

right past my tongue, down my throat.  
I was relieved.  
I wanted to live. There would be  

brownish oceans  
in my future, with brownish waves  
washing up  
on shores. There was  

the purity of wolves devouring  
the purity of rabbits. And  

birds to scribble  
all over the sky. Also  
bored children and dense thickets, full  

of a thousand members  
of an audience  
standing up and clapping  
for a band.  

Concert finally over. Everyone  
deaf, dazed, just  
wanting to get out of there, go home, wishing  
they’d never come.  
I’d be one of them. But  

I’d wait in my seat until the rest had left. Then  
I’d see  
the lead singer  
(too famous to be named) come  
back on stage to find  
a guitar pick he had dropped. He’d  
scowl and wave at me, friendly  
and full of hatred. I smiled  
and shook my head, which  

seemed to startle him. He said, “It  
sucked.” He said, “We suck. But  
at least we know it, don’t we?”  

My reply: it  
was perfect. It  

changed both our lives. We’d  

go on together, forever, and never  
need to speak again. We  

knew what we did best, both of us, after that, and  
we’d do that, exactly—although  

in order for you to believe me  
I must never tell you what I said.

for the crew marooned on an island in the aegean sea,"
At the chunk of rock  
               They moor their ship their only memory  
 It is noon the wind lies down  
               On the warm deck  
 And they gather the lots made of bone  
               Shuffle the playing cards  
 Chance arcs in by the mast  
               In the sound of the collapsing cards  
 The captain will not play the game  
               His daughter is different  
 Master of this place  
               Of measurement and particle  
 He will not let her at the foot of the rock  
               He would like to remain faithful to the instruments  
   
 Still the ship is moored  
               The island is crumbling into the sea  
 When light goes down the waves come up  
               Slip in under the netting  
 Watching through themselves  
               Under the pulsing stars she convokes the crew  
 Voice a rich mezzo she explains her calculations  
               Spilling over a train of papers in her hand  
 Crafted in ink with symmetric diagrams  
               Glossing over the blurred waves  
 There will be no wind for days she says  
               Only the lots will serve here  
 Only the bones the metacarpals  
               Still retain a sense of direction  
 The crew members must nod taken by  
               Her suite of equations her form her diction  
 The meeting is adjourned  
               And the captain unknowing does not observe  
 Later in his daughter’s tent  
               She hums keening music  
 She is hearing something else  
               Which filters down through dusk  
   
 The sound of birds tutoring their young  
               In the violet hew call  
 She is hearing rituals for pulling the sun  
               Passed down through the blood and sound  
 And she fixes the bones of the lot  
               Painting over unprotected cards  
 Shapes the many fingers of chance  
               With the sign of her death  
 She will not be wrong she has dedicated everything  
               To the density of water the statue of Archimedes the covenant with the dead  
 For the captain of the ship she will be  
               Agamemnon’s love in the Aegean  
   
 When morning comes pastel-blue and vaulting  
               She has already entered the fullness of it  
 Again the crew gathers but something is on their lips  
               The captain reaches for his lots  
 Casts the bones up into the blue  
               They hang suspended for a moment  
 Descend down into his fragile hands cupped  
               He throws his shock to the waves  
 Seizes the cards from his oarsman  
               Lays out the five symbols but they confirm it  
 His daughter will be left for the wind  
               To appease nothing some statue in the Acropolis  
 Mixing her body with the rock  
               The crew bursts into sound  
 Wind coming like white noise  
               Tone clusters mechanical voices waves piling up  
 Spilling out from air  
               Bones gaining heat  
 Turning white-hot radiating bodies  
               Now the explosion comes  
 A small bomb shatters them  
               Smoke hovers over  
 Plumes are what is left is  
               Time for them in the frames of the sea  
 The captain’s daughter died here on this rock  
               Has it been two thousand years for her

a lucrative and realistic career,"
  It will have been the next day that I can tell rain

 yesterday. Save that enduring force of your face

  

 behind my eyes, outward-looking. This wills me,

 as the old woman spilling her groceries wills me,

  

 as dusted, caked, erased, pushing trails through—

 as the big sun over the bigger farm house waits.

  

 When arid or when a razed plain, I do not eat,

 save the fruit that reminds me of home. Then,

 I will have been yesterday’s woman, and rain.

At some point  

I had a swollen muscle  

)or a body  

that pretended to be  

one swollen muscle)  

Loaned to me by a tuft of sugar cane  

I don’t know how to hold sweetness  

or vastness the right way  

Like a poacher caressing dirt  

before cutting for some long absent bone  

What I’ve been able to hold has long  

been lost in a hole of the white  

porcelain of one whole universe’s heirlooms  

Cartography is just the  

impulse to jump  

off of things  

The righteous have since discovered  

a black hole with its maw wide open  

Who can compete  

with that kind of devotion?  

I certainly can’t  

My stomach  

Won’t hold any more of  

The universe’s ash  

I’ll cough it up in the yard  

Next to the ire and the musk  

and the citrus tree  

While the man across the street  

gives audience with pillaging eyes  

At my wither  

at my pinked failure  

Who will hold my hair  

when that love escapes  

my mothering tendon  

Who will hold me through

Draping sleeves

of a white coat drag

and the seams of them are openly unraveling like spiderwebs.  
 

I question the small stitch

missed. The flat white is a glass dam.

Fear and pain wells up on the other side.

I can see it in their eyes

threads of glass

coarse and aching.

What are words or tears or touch

when all is smooth and closed? I don’t

know either. I stand and watch the dam make a deep lake deeper

the fish drinking the blood water

and becoming fat. Alone

the spider travels from epicenter to edge

and the web is stark

and scentless beneath its legs.

dollar dollar bill,"
One more Jacobean kiss  
and you’ll wind up related to me.  
One more emotion  
and I’m coming for you, like a sparrow.  
Set your phenomenology  
on the windowsill.  
Filthy, meet Family. Family,  
I want to get marketable again.  
In the mean time, what are your thoughts  
on a completely male garden?  
As little closure, maybe, as there is  
a permanence? This being, also, the time  
of the wandering Miss Americas.  
Loose thumb-bones, rattling  
in a mint tin. One more emotion  
and both Dakotas will explode.  
One more condition  
and I’ll be exiting my relevance.  
And what was it, finally,  
so dead about him, Family?  
I think I just saw a fox.  
Yes, with its little foxen teeth,  
like Ezekiel’s. Of course, you were off busy,  
revising your plague journals.  
Bringing clock to the belt-line  
of Orion. What could’ve you done  
about the remaining days  
no longer outnumbering us?  
Voice of the dying groupie  
like a deck of cards being shuffled.  
One last electromagnetic pulse,  
one last electromagnetic pulse,  
and the neutral bodies of the dead  
dropping from our larger, living bodies.  
The truth? I thought the castration threat  
a touch on the heavy side of the tonality.  
But you got your point across.  
And by then, we were a much  
cleaner people, anyway.

To hear myself say it

 To listen to myself saying it to you

 Cares why I said it 

 That I said it for a reason

 Or not, to you or not to you.

 When I said it I said it

 On the street, by the pier, in a city

 On the water.

 I said it in the forests

 Of America. A little songbird

 Who is frightened of the moon

 She hears me say it to you

 Who listen, I hear her

 Who hears me too.

 I don't think she listens 

 When I say it. 

 She sings to us the vowels

 In a sequence--ee, ah, oo, ay; ee, ah, oo, ay.

 Did Helen say it to Clytemnestra.

 Did Jack Spicer

 Overhear her say it to me.

 I believe what I hear

 In dreams, the people who speak

 From inside me in dreams

 Who whisper to me

 The whys and hows of saying 

 It to you. I cain't believe

 I said it to you.

 Are there any good poems 

 About saying it.

 If you find one let me know.

as a globed fruit,"


This time, I want it to be simple: say you are  
a fresh, cool lemon. Your rind is dotted with wet.  

Say I have a tongue and lick away the wetness,  
have hands and excavate the seeds.  

I pull you out of yourself. I raise newness.  
Everything tastes yellow and the sea-line is a line  

down my throat. The lemon is a line across  
the sky and that too is what you are: everything  

mistaken for something else, the citrus getting larger, blooming.  
Are you blooming? Are you in bloom? Tell me how you feel.  

You don’t have to be a lemon if you don’t want to.  
The rind could slip from my hand, if you asked for it.  

I only want to speak to you. I’ve known lemons before:  
tendrils of fruit clutching to the white, hand unhooked,  

every cold, flowered thing giving way to water. Things change  
when I speak and fruits flower, open slowly, without knowing it.  

Try this: the dig of your finger under stem, stopping  
crooked between flesh and peel. So what if when I dream  

I dream citrus? I can taste even the farthest slick of air,  
unlace semblance from skin. I can feed in pieces.  

When I call out your name, it is your name  
before it is anything else.  

Later, I can ask you about the rest.

 when certain ghost seem

 just before dawn

 how you wake

  

 to a wet lawn with no

 memory of the storm

  

 that’s what the blood

 is like, you point

  

 to it & ask how it got there

 you can’t imagine

  

 a storm you can’t see

 even if the winds

  

 are ripping my body

 into fifths, even if

  

 your body is the lightning

 I seek shelter from.

  

 if tomorrow is my turn

 to be the body on the news

  

 will you mourn me or

 blame me? will I be a tragedy

  

 or a tradition? will you

 retweet me? will you

  

 change your profile pic

 will you bother

 to learn my name?

 do you only feel sadness

 when the victims are white?

  

 who do you pray for

"
the old era and the wolf girl,"
You secretly try to howl my heart,

 a thousand years I've lain listening as you howled among bones.

 Our souls were two bullets shot at each other,

 when our corpses like buried cities are half uncovered,

 you secretly try to howl my heart.

  

 You secretly try to howl my heart,

 ruins flow through veins like a dead man's lost body.

 Our tunnels back to you were choked up with mud and clay,

 when the peal of a bell breaks through the wine cup,

 you secretly try to howl my heart.

  

 You secretly try to howl my heart,

 Oghuz Khan followed you here in dark nights bending toward the moon.

 Our oval heads did battle before the flag,

 in the window dusk when we blind each other like mindless birds,

 you secretly try to howl my heart.

  

 You secretly try to howl my heart,

 what broken and clumsy corpses we are!

 The last ladies in waiting, king and manservants bury us,

 and in that arrowhead where our souls find peace,

 you secretly try to howl my heart.

ambitions,"
Someone smashed last

 week through the neighbor’s

 glass back door

 and stole his electric guitar.

  

 Or the mouse in the trap:

 Sweet crumb still sweetening

 between its teeth, and the whole

 history of its species, in

 attics, in grain sacks, in

  

 the golden ideal of the golden field.

  

 The way the sad child returns to his

 sad seat

 after sharpening his pencil.

  

 Or the newlyweds’ rowboat

 at the bottom of an ocean.

  

 And the woman on the front porch

 who keeps discarding things from her heart:

  

 The deathbed.  The divorce.  The friend

 in the restaurant

 in the booth near the window. The glass.

 The glare.  The impatience

  

 on her friend’s face as the friendship ended.

  

 Somewhere tonight a thief

 is attempting to play

 an electric guitar.

 The wolves have already worn

 a dark path in the grass around his house.

 They’ve

  

 not yet

 begun to howl.

 But they will howl:

  

 These great ambitions, slinking

 back one day

 through the mess they’ve made

 to return

 the infernal thing.

"
there are days blurred,"
There are days blurred like the skin  
of fruit rotting, when we look into the water  
and cannot tell if the dark stripes  
shuddering over the surface  
are the reflections of street lamps  
or just our shadows. Such days  
do not have matching nights, unless  
they are white nights, but then  
each night is crossed out  
 by the black stroke of a morning  
 where a dead man lies on a table,  
 already a stranger, like a  
simple object at which a child  
peers through a rolled up notebook page,  
 willing it further and further away.  
 You wake and press your face  
 to the plaster, folding your hands  
on your lap, your starched sheet,  
a prayer passing from your cheek  
to the wallpaper. No, you are not  
God’s favorite doll. We open and close  
our eyes for Him dutifully, but He  
only uses us for our ability to forget.

"
elegy,"
 

  

 Morning expands one rib at a time  
speaks through the pinktops of pines        On the porch  
I write to a friend whose mother has passed  
Blue fog is a doe that startles  
at my cough        I drink black water from its eye

   
This isn't about half-dreamt things  
The veil over the lake about to boil a man  
It's too quiet to answer anything but the tongue-colors  
of the east        fern-light slices from a mandoline

   
My words are bad acreage  
I think of taking my friend’s grief     for him holding it  
above my head & wading out     It is clear I can see the sand  
I tell myself this is helping    this is what the heart looks like working

   
Each step     the outbreath  
There is a boat & a man moving his line  
He’s throwing longer & longer threads  
to the still dark

"
our bodies are full of veins and yet,"
Our bodies are full of veins and yet   
we do not ever notice. The trees that came   
in a shower of red as we too felt   
the ground pushing up against us   
are now thrusting out and up and still   
we are pumped down as something else   
in us pushes to be out. A flock of birds   
growing dark on a branch are knobs   
of the tree, but softer, and when   
they startle, all at once, is it because   
something has flown up in our ribs   
and cannot move any further.   
The birds are always breaking and   
re-gathering. They land on the same   
tree again and again, and we cannot   
even stop looking. Before the warmth   
began to invade, I had already felt sleep   
being pushed out, the thick comfort   
of winter moving to make way for what,   
that peculiar terror that comes, when,   
having lived for years in a house not    
especially loved, someone wakes up   
to each of the vases gone, and finds   
herself instead in an orchard filled   
with crabapple trees. What’s worse   
is that the trees are beautiful.   
How can anyone who passes by them,   
singing, ignore them, those leaves   
thrumming into green, arching for the red   
buried in lips and palms, the color they cannot   
have until they are dying, and when   
your back grows with a cut I put   
my mouth on it. You are only the flight   
of blood in migration again and again   
and when I touch you I cannot disappear.   
It is not that we grow dimmer as night comes,   
but that colors converge, and only then   
do I know that there is nothing telling me   
who you are—not the sharp trees behind us,   
not the clearness of the bricks—with their colors,    
the way a boy passing by the river makes   
shadow animals with his hands and doesn’t   
even know where the light is coming from.   
He moves his thumb to make the wolf bite,   
then one creature breaks into two   
and they are both dancing, and when   
the boy goes home it’s not that he doesn’t   
notice the light on the trees is suddenly   
thicker but that he’s thinking of how   
the sound of the river could help him pretend   
to be underwater if only he closed his eyes,   
and each of the lights taste like nothing   
you or I have ever tasted. If only   
the light could remember voices,   
remember music pearling across leaves   
and breaking in the center of a grove   
of trees with bark inches rougher   
than any grain of our flesh, would it be   
as if we were there and again there,   
would the boy singing with his hands   
as he crosses the river at night know   
that music could never bring her back, but   
it can make them cry, and something   
might remember us, the way the grooves   
in the branches of the tree must   
remember, over and again, the dip   
under the weight of birds.

"
aniseed in sand,"
Comes on and quickly: A thin worm slips sylphlike  
              into the inner ear and spirals to line the cochlea  
                           in coil, rests, bloats and distends, widens cavity

walls, bloats down to the throat and my head cocks  
              under its weight. My evening shadow clutches, clasps  
                           a tuft of hair pulling me toward her, serving

as further proof that shadows want flesh to buckle slump, stretch  
              horizontal to sow substance where there is none. Especially up-market,  
                           up high and uphill, this soil swills envy and its variations.

The torque saddles my spleen and my legs move like crabs,  
              corybantic and feral to stand in for gravity and the plane.  
                           *Dear shade, dear daemon, do not muster, do not envy.*

With this motion I descend, towed. A shipping heir  
              gifts me a bouquet. Tucks one sanguine rose behind my ear.  
                           My teeth tear at the rose-tops. The pluck not mine, I cannot stop.

There is nothing precious about the periphery and  
              molars are equally useless if they fall out. *Let go please**  
 *                          *shadow sister watch me swear you one wisdom tooth.*

Unstead unbalanced I bare my rose-stained teeth  
              with foreign fury, spit the petals and hurl the stems. Descending, nearing  
                           the port now. *Please loosen your grip we are *one *you* one *I*.

The shipping heir follows. Asks a merchant seaman for  
              aniseed boiled in water and left on the stovetop of Commerce.  
                           The seaman asks his nursing wife who asks

what for. Is this heart-ache or is this worm-  
              wood lodged under or has it reached the ear.  
                           White linen is most beautiful stained with attar

and umber—when it speaks for itself—for what unstained  
              is ever permanent? On this ashy shore I have no resolve or  
                           resolution. Drive is driven. *We must hurtle together regardless*.

*Our history is express, likewise our en-  
 *             *rapture. *Respect’s deckhand once carried a para-  
                           sol, which has since rusted over in the aromatic

nothing we will soon be glad to remember  
              with clarity. *Sister Anise, sister shadow, I am spinning.*  
                           *Retrograde. In sand. Crab-like legs one needle.*

With the three spins before the gyroscope falls  
              its needle traces my name in the ash-sand.  
                           When the rim touches down my orb-skull cracks.

Captive liquid falls in tears, which fill the cursive:  
              a self-portrait too sad to admit agency and yet  
                           this is a flavor I have wrung myself. A flavor

for which I have obtained a Protected Designation  
              of Origin which means what I choose will choose  
                           to swell inside me and it always tastes how it was made.

This flavor is black but brilliant, the incan-  
              descent paragon of lustre and forgetting  
                           *taste my parsley of enmity, an-*

*imus, anisum.* I taste acquired  
              like black licorice or leucorrhea.  
                           Like ouzo in brine,* I drink you,* like:

Umbilical. Milk that’s pressed from stalks.  
              Umbellifer. Milk of noontime, milk that calls me back.  
                           Umbra. Milk of malice, milk that soothes no aches.

A wild wheel leaking prone like spleen: seed and sown.

"
in my dream the old woman had a ribbon for the boy,"
In my dream the old woman had a ribbon for the boy  
  
and the ribbon had a message.  What to make  
  
of this.  That the woman I dreamed of had a penis  
  
on her knee she could find no one to hold.  
  
That the man who is central plays guitar  
   
and all he wants is to be loved.

 

I seemed to be that man whose death is his security,  
  
whose stony head will model stony crown.  
  
Who turns away predators with assiduity  
  
dips his head to swallow wide  
   
reflections in the body.

 

The brain’s a map that’s flat.  
  
Don’t expect to feel the incision.  
  
Nerves don’t end there.

"
tracking,"
Crocus, dark   
bulb starting a slim leaf,   
you hide your blade   
at your stomach.

Soon it will ease   
into dirt, a small tongue   
to kiss silt. A cut.

Love, I don’t have   
a grip on tenderness—   
those ruffed crests   
of pampas grass crush

in my hands.  I test   
red blades beneath:   
they slit gills along   
my fingers. I travel

from red edge to feathers,   
is this tender?  I can’t   
be sure.  I saw a goose   
swoop up. She left like

an adze wedged into   
wooden clouds. I stood,   
rooted. We decided   
to accept our luck,

the way a mare lowers   
her nose over a fence,   
parts shuttered lips:   
Here’s her overbite.

She clicks at slipped apples,   
her teeth close   
around fruit   
precisely as calipers;

although leaves are tapping   
against apples,   
and thrumming like bells   
through white fields.

Now this morning,   
after rain, when streets gleam   
like syrup, you   
are the woman who stretches,

tipping her chin back. Outside,   
dark arrows pass   
at the window.  Birds   
sound a quiver of distances.

Inside the room,   
light girds our two bodies   
like wire in a cloisonné bowl,   
glazed and separate enamels.

"
nothing loses leaves its all forever losing leaves,"
A splitting tree stands wind-shook by

 the slender trees swaying lost branches

 scarred low on their sides, stands

  

 lately deciduous, weighted thin

 with first fall. Along Sha Wan Drive

 towards the pool the yellow oleander

  

 flowered like wet tissue ceaselessly

 like paper rain, the grained cement

 the yellow, yellow oxidizing white

  

 the dogs you’d muzzle not to let them

 have a taste. My mother takes us

 to the pool, it’s maybe June, canary

  

 petals landing on our heads, my sister

 small enough she wears my t-shirt

 for a dress, the cinder is so slick

  

 with petaled rot—it used to seem at least

 a life so deadly might not ever die—

 my mother catches a heel, falls

  

 she sends us both ahead to wait for her

 thirteen years ago up past the trees.

 If we could be there still perhaps

  

 I’d run to her, kneel in the dappled light

 piece the foot together from concrete

 although we are each different women now.

  

 Up here the whitened apples nod on trees;

 shrubs waste to burgundy anemone in snow.

 All that grows leaves is breaking

  

 all splits at root. Some mends. I’ll watch

 those slim arms birth entire skies of buds.

 Behind me at the gate in the warm rot

  

 my mother, foot stuck in a gutter, stands

 and all her pain is yellow blooms.

 is this measure

 into cover, each color breaking 

 the seams, tensed

  

 in their dew and refracted as 

 a parched red in brown shadowed 

 and swallowed by 

 a canopy roof seen

  

 from below. the trees empty themselves

 to the ground, 

 their figures rotting 

 as winnowed outlines rent

  

 in all direction. the same image

 that reaches into my lungs and 

 takes. pulling away

 my inside. pulling the fear that I

  

 had missed the coming

 until I had already arrived. a feeling 

 as small and as bare as

 the process of a home. 

  

 I am aware 

 of all of this. I 

 am accepting. it,

 coming lightened by

  

 its own absence, in the morning, 

 when all other morning things are still

 undisturbed. the quiet

 fastening of self-

  

 poverty. as the dew formed overnight

 in the folds of a palm fall and 

 will split, bearing away the progress

 overhung. so yes.

from the google maps car,"
In the end, all maps, self-led by vestigial scent,

melted or forgotten, caressing their digital sisters—

the ones with aptitudes, subtracting the call of danger—fail

to render. The mapmaker pretends to engross in

topography, moves out of state, divorces & takes

up with a sultry 3rd dimension, sprawling in her loft & breathing

cigarettes of middling price & quality. They make love.

 

Sibling to yawning July, the drought built to last.

The photographer skirts the outskirts, compiling as he

pleases: their streets, their sisters, the upset grass,

the amoebae in the sky—always so far?

He learns that content & content

are not always the same; his sister morphs into

a mailbox (empty). I have no interest in the Messiah, he says,

unless He creeps into Street View

rifling his leaflets & then I’d have to digitally scan Him.

The 3-D version, still in development,

will include an immersive Danger Zone—

we can’t get to Syria, except by the News,

which is a different design—

there is no tab, a simulation will have to suffice:

the pucker of loosened gravity,

the click & drag & drag & drag . . .

 

The photographer, which is us, spares no one,

remembers his father mostly for the cigarettes,

he bridges the gaps in memory with real dyslexia.

What street, what ‘burb could surmount the creeping din:

explosions of nothing, words of nothing,

each surveyed road calling ghosts too stupid,

too gone to cry out: Google Map for a Google Earth?

Somewhere out west, two hours from where he was conceived,

then born, then switched into a long range

of broken sisters, the cropped shadows, chopped pixels,

he sees another. I have too many grounds yet to cover, he says,

I am misunderstood.

"
the poem of the mind,"
The poem of the mind starts with a question,

 But which one?  It fears the “loss of problems”

 Wittgenstein feared, it finds its pleasure in the

 Trance that suddenly comes over one, the dawning

 Of a new romance, the promise offered one last time.

 Come here, it seems to say (a plea addressed to no one),

 Come with me down this course.  No one answers

 Of course, because the way is solitary and the end

 Uncertain, but it doesn’t matter in the end.  Like someone

 Walking in his sleep who dreams of walking in his sleep,

 It gradually becomes the thing that it envisions, simultaneously    

 Inhabiting and moving towards an unknown destination.

 You think you’ve read it all before, and of course you have,

 For the poem of the mind is inexhaustible.  It never ends,

 As the mind never ends, yet sometimes disappears from view

 Before emerging in a new form, one resembling the old form

 As one day resembles another, or the mild afternoon light  

 Resembles that of its first morning, the site of its first illusion.

 It treasures its illusions, for they’re what it is and where it lives:

 Wandering through the gallery of lost illusions, it pauses

 Before one or two, before the catastrophe of reality intrudes—

 Bone smashed on asphalt, gunshot blowing out the head—

 And then continues on.  It isn’t a question of belief or disbelief,

 But of a freedom from belief, an acquiescence in appearance.

 To be satisfied with appearance is to be perpetually unsatisfied

 A small voice says, and yet its reservation goes unheeded.

 Who could actually live that way?  How else? goes the reply.

 I’m just like you, if you don’t ask me what that means.

 The poem of the mind portrays an almost vacant mind

 Whose thoughts remain unfinished, like the unfinished paintings

 Hanging on the studio wall above the blood-splattered floor.

 When does it turn, the way a sonnet turns?  When do questions

 Take on a grammar of their own, answering themselves

 Day after day, until the inwardness becomes as unbearable

 As an encroaching blindness?  This is what eternal life must be:

 To live completely in the present, locked in a self-absorption

 So intense its end is unimaginable, where nothing can be real

 Outside its own arena of awareness, like the shot it can’t hear,

 The crash it can’t feel.  Feelings are supposed to be its heart,

 But they’re imaginary feelings, based on an imaginary life.

 It posits an indifferent life behind the real one, an indifferent

 World that wanes and waxes as a whole, yet never really

 Changes: happy for a day, and then unhappy on the next,

 But what’s the difference?  Parts are real too, and even

 Fragments have to come to something in the end.  At length

 It starts to settle and subside: the morning light is gradual

 In the window, as the contours of a vague presence

 That wasn’t there before emerge.  Here you are,

 It says to itself.  I’m glad you’ve finally come home.

 The impulse that engendered its convulsive exercise

 Pulls back and takes a breath, recasting its answer

 In the form of a new question, as the poem of the mind

 Returns at last to its beginning, and is satisfied.

"
im sad im not a beast,"
*After the poem of the same name by Alexander Vvedensky* I’m sad I’m not a beast

 asprint down some blue lane

 whispering confidences to my

  

        self : let’s wait a little

        we’ll go walk in the woods with you

        to gawk at the paltry leaves

  

 I wish I were a star

 running seeking that one nest

 to drown in – none

 could hear that star making creakings

 to embolden the silence of fish

  

        I have a complaint

        : I’m not a rug , nor a hydrangea

  

 I’m sad I’m not a roof

 falling – little by little – in

 for whom death is only a moment

 wet with rain

  

        I dislike that I’m mortal

        I’m sad I’m inexact

  

 I’m sad I’m not a chalice

 I hate that I’m not pity

 I’m not even a copse

 that sheathes itself with leaves

  

        It’s hard to be with the minutes

        Who have wasted me so badly

  

        It’s terribly offensive to me

        That I’m visible currently

  

 It’s awful to me that I move

 not at all like a worm

 The worm rips burrows into

 the earth and plants conversations

  

        Earth , where are your works

  

 the cold worm says to her

 and Earth , disposing of the dead

 , keeps quiet

  

        ( she knows it’s not like that )

  

 I’m scared I have before me

 two identical things

 I don’t see how they’re different

 how each one lives , independent

  

 I’m scared I have before me

 two identical things

 I don’t see how eager they are

 to look like one another

  

        We’re sitting with you , wind

        atop this deathly pebble

  

 and here , at the tip of the letter

 I put down the word *box*

 I set *box* in its place

 : its substance is thick dough

  

        I don’t like that I’m mortal

        I’m sad I’m inexact

  

        I still have a complaint

        : I’m not a rug , nor a hydrangea

  

 we’ll go walk in the woods with you

 to gawk at the paltry leaves . . .

 I’m sad that on those leaves

 I won’t see the unnoticed words

  

        called : instance , called : immortality

        called : view from the beginning

  

 I’m scared I’m not an eagle

 I’m sad I’m not a seed

 The worm crawls over all

 He bears monotony

  

 I’m scared that I’m unknown

 I’m sorry I’m not flame

CD3 gets closer,"


Last week, scientists found a new moon:  
a second one, peculiar and small.  

The poets will be excited. Maybe now  
they can write about the moon without consequence  
  
since it will be new, and free of tropes.  
Perhaps they will hang on it like honey.  
  
There’s a part of me that thinks if we can get a new moon  
then maybe anything could happen. Like maybe I could hand you  
  
a spoonful of the moonlet, and you could pour it down my chin.  
Maybe the poets could eat goat cheese by the river, and listen  
  
to Kate Bush on repeat. We could design a little ocean,  
just the two of us, pulling tides up along contiguous shores.  
  
They say the new moon could’ve been there for years.  
And what would we have done—  
  
written twice as many poems? Held an eggshell, a spoon,  
in our hands, like a lover returning? Listened to Kate Bush?  
  
I do those things anyway. I’d like to do them with you,  
with our small impermanent moon.  
"

 you are a closet.

 did you turn me

the restroom,"


It’s become as ordinary now  
as seeing my face reflected  

in the bathroom mirror,  
or hovering over the porcelain  

toilet. I think, it’s been  
nine years since you’ve died.  

I’ve made an invisible list  
of what you’ve missed. You never  

met the man I’ve married. Or  
sipped that aromatic bougie drink  

at the restaurant with smoked  
meats, or pet my dog, or toured  

my new house. It’s unfair  
but sometimes I pretend you’d  

hate it all, judge him, dismiss  
the podunk town we live in,  

just to make myself feel better.  
Other days, your face appears  

behind mine laughing in the mirror,  
me sharing a sideways secret  

about my life that you never  
asked for while, outside, someone  

hammers away at the door.

on this night of our choosing,"
On this day of our choice

 we have collected

 at forests like

 some insect

 varietals

 beetling their way

 to the heart of

 the copse. We have

 coalesced for

 the moment as

 dewdrops do

 bivouac in the

 abdomen of leaves

 pooling tensility

 against atomizing

 sun or its reflection

 sprung from mica

 pieces studding

 the sharp loam.

 The tenderfooted

 will wince

 the shod shall

 advance this day

 of our choice when

 we pass separate

 through the wood

 to track in packs

 paths whose blaze

 is merely what

 we toss ahead.

 All hopes into

 mouths of our

 beer cans are fed

 crumpled jettisoned

 and come upon

 twenty yards

 down the trail

 as though left

 to augur for

 us there. But

 no other has

 before stood

 here with legs

 spread open as

 a pair of shears

 pin-stuck in the

 soil like sign

 of a miracle.

 Here the trees

 are deplumed

 limbs mangled

 and gray like

 stone jali hiding

 others gone other

 ways this day

 of our choosing

 foreshortened to

 evening already.

 No two paths

 cross and were

 they to they

 might as wires

 sparking this

 night of our

 choosing to fire

 but uncovering

 a charcoal plain

 across which we

 might see one

 another again.

obscenity test for polite company,"
I pick my gap-toothed cunt up off the floor.

 I can feel it in my lap, trembling there

 like a small insect. 

  

 Oh cut the crap dear cunt, I tell it. 

 The time it took the ocean to carve this valley,

 that was one day in the life of a cunt.

  

 Cunt of cordage and rigging, of shock

 and sigh of wave. Then, yes—

 with such strangeness it opens,

  

 gives name to the sounds that rise early

 at my window: wind and leaf

 and leafblower and the opened husk 

  

 of sun. The cunt could name mountains,

 but its paper wings just beat and beat.

 in the evening a single sided coin, indicating roundness,

 a tangerine phosphorescing in plastic bag.

  

 it is bagged, the moon, and the woman

 sighs against her crescent toed shoes

 while a thunderous shadow of teeth

  

 afflict the pitted moon, which the woman

 keeps in a pocket to save for the afternoon,

 swallowing pieces, spitting seeds.

  

 the artillery of the street batters her ears,

 hums against the weight of her tangerine

 and her moon, chatters her teeth, bears her heels

  

 along the flat avenue, which carries shreds

 of a confetti donkey lately bursted

 with chocolate coins papering the streets

  

 like dimes of gold leaf. she can feel

 her feet taking root, the artillery of cars

 pushing through the drums of her ears.

  

 she will become a gold statue, a daughter

 of midas, frozen throwing arm in midair

 to try and send some part of her self to the moon.

the human condition,"

*After Magritte (1935) and Leone (1966)*  


Doctors promise it is not so, but I swear I am  
going deaf in my left ear. Unequivocally, this is  
more humiliating for them than it is for me.  

After all, I have done the tests, snapped my fingers  
on left and right, heard the difference in pitch  
like the small slaps of waves under the hull.  

Once, in a floating hotel, I was given no pillow,  
told the sound of the river would be my cushion.  

Still, I couldn’t fall out of time there, couldn’t still  
the thrum of my pulse: something about sweeping  
and ticking, the dull shush of the sand.  

It’s like that sometimes on dim afternoons,  
a slow wade into late lunch and oyster crackers,  
when the real sense of small apocalypse creeps in.  

It rolls by, the tumbleweed a minute before high noon,  
the shrill, smoking, wild-west beat like boiling water.  

The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, each passing like a hiccup  
because the throat makes no such distinctions when parched.  
It simply cries out, then sleeps.  

In the Western, the cowboy hero. Drygulched  
when he least expects it. Bandits rustle his steer. Revolvers pop  
like whips. Again and again, owl eyes stare with apathy.  

There is much in this world that is unspeakable,  
and so much silence worlded by its thingness.  

Like the leeward side of a mountain, which is deserted  
by the rain, lying in its shadow. The silent rock as it stands.  
There is only one thing in the universe that is like an ocean.  

Somehow, it all spins like a quarter on the sticky bar counter,  
the illusion of fullness, a silver berry, for a second. Then the drop.  
Something about sweeping and ticking.

 provisional. I had forgotten that summer was an emotion. Small speckled eggs. As the sun set they

 cooked dinner on Bolinas beach. Amarillo ramp. Tho it was too crowded to see the front of the bus, I

 These flowers bloom in fog. I am Marion Delgado. This is the stage of anti-imperialist struggle. WE begin

 everyone. A tunnel under the river that would take you from Detroit to Canada. Amarillo ramp. Herons

 wading in the shallow water. I had forgotten that summer was an emotion. She was a visitor. Tho it was

 too crowded to see the front of the bus, I could see the sun-illumined faces of the boarders, the light in

 their hair, reflected on the inside of a window a few seats ahead of me. I am Marion Delgado. Patrick

 climbed into his Chinese drag. Over cocktails, relaxed, taking in not one but several conversations at

 once, I tended to mix the various responses. Woman in a pink pantsuit, head tipped forward, asleep. We

"
i am filling the creases,"
I am filling the creases on your neck   
and your palms, from which sand

once rose, as from the creases of   
a sidewalk where a parched wind

wrestles. The unfolding of   
your back revels in its grace as though

it were a sickness, or falling   
leaves curling around

a current of air. My hands   
falling on yours, my hands

on your unfolding back,   
especially on your unfolding back, 

become poplar leaves. That I cannot   
hide in a crease your smile

makes in your cheek is   
my one regret as I let my eyes

shut out the light: unseen,   
it will dissolve the gentle weight

of distances. I know how to   
stop and start at the brim.   
  
  


"
symphony of kaleidoscopes,"
2013,

  

 I

  

 on a dizzy morning in june

 my eyes were rubbed against the view

        of that piazza

 you should see those kaleidoscopes

 - even as a child of ten

 i could never take my eyes off of them-

 for the very first time, as if in a dream

        i saw the reality;

 my beard grown out,

 and my voice cracking,

 and seeing

 words could be tender

 no matter what

  

 i was thinking of those desks

 those school desks dangling in my mind

        as like question marks

 in those school days still capturing my mind

 and to those dangerous questions

 we used to raise our hands

 under the shadow of the rotten stringers

 so many unanswered questions has left

 a couple thousands of us

 trying to explain

 the close range between innocence and rage:

 rage is cruel without innocence

 innocence is submission

        without rage, said a man

 (on his eyebrows there was blood and sand)

  

 on that morning

 we had already burnt down the desks

 our kaleidoscopes were in pieces

  

 no rust left on the stringer

 no lies in our words

  

 II

  

 the day was booming.

 colosseum tumbling down

        for the very first time

 the earth was seen as it was:

 the surface split in two,

 two different orchestras, earth in polyphony,

 one telling us kurt huber’s dead

 the other playing shostakovic, the 7th symphony!

  

 On that very day

 just like a dissident string

        breaking loose from a violin

 the city broke loose

        from the earth. 

"
open ocean falls,"
For S.P.—

  

 Open ocean

 falls closing into

 the white past dark blue

  

 where bound, in sand,

 in sun, blood, we lie

 unopened: five years

  

 of love – still

 it runs caught: every cell

 is a blue diver falling

  

 the volume under papyrus stretched,

 its inner face bathed as in tea –

 to look old? You look

 lived in, like home

                                        till

 the diver surfaces, volume

 unbinds – till the page

 cracks, read –

                              the ocean has never

 opened –

  

 the tea leaves its leaves

             (the waves turn over)

 the sea leaves and leaves

             (almost in sleep)

 we leave love

"
parrot,"


      Stranger, uninvited, you  
come up to us on the sidewalk,  

my daughter’s hand in mine, you  
look at her &  

coo, *It goes so fast.* What, stranger,  
is this unnamed *it*—this day?  

her life? our  

happiness? Stranger, maybe you  
missed it, but just now  

my daughter & I hurled  

rocks into the emptiness  
& we created more  

emptiness.  


"
dawn redwood,"
  Early morning light: a young red-tailed hawk

 glided onto an overhead branch and peered

  

 down at me, but it did not look with your eyes—

 a battered and rusted pickup lies in the wash;

  

 Navajo tea buds on the trail—I headed back

 and checked, in the boiler room, the traps,

  

 baited with peanut butter—now a gnat

 flits against this lit screen: where are you now?

  

 One morning, we walked in a Rhode Island

 cemetery and did not look at a single gravestone;

  

 we looked at hundred-year-old copper beeches,

 cells burnished purple, soaking up sunshine,

  

 and talked about the dawn redwood,

 how the glimmering light at the beginning

  

 of the world was in all things. This morning,

 in the predawn darkness, Orion angled

  

 in the eastern sky with Sirius, low,

 above the ridgeline; and, before daylight

  

 blotted out the stars, I heard you speak,

 *the scratched words return to their sleeves*.

"
nicholas,"

Honey locust and the fishing rod.  
Hook silvered creek.  

You say a river baptized your grandpa.  
And from the canopy of branches,  

you step into this purl of rain  
to hold a bream like a sheet of copper.  

Gods change things all the time.  
Your feet into cattails, fingers ox eyes—  

tomatoes lipped on spun vines.  
Hold one, cut one. Who knew light could do that?  

Each summer, you are one chalked fir  
snagged on a feral green hill.  

The heavy rust rattle of cicadas.  
Three hawks in the brush.  

If not the moon,  
then a word for it.  

Who knew what sons we might have in spring?  
Mine, the warm glide of his hair.  

"
orion,"

In my dream the dead have arrived  
as escorts. We travel  

past cold hills and wolves  
wild in a deadlocked field. A corporation  

of stars cracks overhead. I lean  
my hand where the hunting dogs  

chase the rabbit, and they tell me  
constellation means assembled  

for life. Then they lend me  
a shovel and dissolve into night.  

There is no other way back. I dig  
through snow until the cold metal strikes.  
"
adiabatic,"
                  down the sink : rushed water

funnels after fish entrails, or grease gives

a type of collapse 

                inward, frying in a pan

fennel-seasoned. An equation equates 

oil and flowers, fields and division. Descent

is a disintegration by parts. What is missing?

 

I want to peer down at myself from above

and point out algae. How my grandfather

took me to the pond 

       for the gutting of it—

one blink’s worth too much. Why isn’t there 

more inside? Why isn’t there more to bleed, 

protrude, be stripped? All these still stalks

 

come from somewhere. Fennel was a field,

was a marathon, was a death in a field 

under clouds of phosphate.

      I slice a fish

sideways and grasp at the inside. Now

things go quickly, death is its own mass

and caves in time toward the event, and

 

viewed from without,

each second slows to a whisper

                         never to cross

over. Here. Here seem all horizons 

to end the same, bundled up in one ribbon 

 

tucked between the teeth and tongue.

poem in which my faggotry fakes its own death,"
On the eighth day, coquelicot, <br/>
wearing my Armageddon earring,<br/>

my faggotry jumped to its death<br/>
from the foam spire of its death.<br/>

& on the ninth: in paradise, titmice <br/>
scrubbed its pearls with aftermath flax.<br/>

From its suicide note: So men might <br/>
once again flip you buffalo nickels.<br/>

The being inside my having been so <br/>
delicately razed itself into wondrous pink.<br/>

Meaning my faggotry carried all of astrology <br/>
& I wanted only the varmint baubles,<br/>

little sex cowlick with which I coaxed<br/>
maw into morrow, morrow into morning.<br/>

How many times could I wake like that:<br/>
gowns & waxwings, the paler gust before<br/>

the gust that everyone remembers with a notch<br/>
in the wall when a prodigal boy molts past his pastness?<br/>

How many times could I join the hundred<br/>
apocryphal boys nursing their empire stitch?<br/>

Their faggotries, too, nixed themselves<br/>
with lovability’s long & bedazzled shears:<br/>

drowned in a tub filled with pink milk,<br/>
Alice’d by an extra-large bottle of Rush.<br/>

To build trust, we plunged the javelin of fey<br/>
suspicion, deep & darkling, inch by inch,<br/>

deeper into each other. I think we sought<br/>
a new unto, as in the boys we barely let <br/>

ourselves struggle to be, as in two yuan<br/>
pieces, silver & tinkling, nearly crushing<br/>
each other into the bottom of a celadon<br/>
demitasse given as a gift by a lover who,<br/>

nightly, conspired to push our faggotry<br/>
from the glottal stopgap of the word<br/>

he never said but always meant: not fickle, no, <br/>
not fanged—but blood, yes, & its heavy shimmer.

The cottonwood was snowing

 I laid the back of my head into the grass

 I thought grass and I woke up with pollen on my eye

 I waited for the wind to come into my hair, lift it like a pile of leaves

 I waited for the white blossoms to stop around me

 I waited until I heard gravel crackling on the asphalt

 Walking back down the road, the shovel I dragged along left a scratch

 I felt the trees around me stabbing up reaching up all up

 For a second, the sky could be torn from the earth

burning wheat,"
I am that comet you all have cursed,

 in the dark void drifting aimless and unsettled.

 Love me like an avenger's lost

 last chance at revenge.

  

 I am that person whose shadow was carved on the tree,

 and from that day on taken for dead.

 Love me like a hallucination

 in a crazed killer's fevered brain.

  

 I am that wheat that Heaven too has singed with fire,

 that has shivered even from the dog days' sunlight.

 Love me like a masochist.

 As you cherish reason when the unreasonable surround you.

  

 I am that wolf whose cold bright bones the witch doctor holds in her hand.

 To soil, to air, to flame, to water I will scatter like a spell.

 Love me like miracles not seen even when sun and moon align

 in the sixth degree under the sign of the ram.

"
the lease,"
No one alive knows what my body is feeling right now but 

 there’s a way of working it out, and there’s someone who 

 knows how to do that, except first we need to wait for the

 right conditions, and in the meantime send our strength out

 into the disabling humidity to sweat itself into as many drops

 as required for oversight of the metropolis called nowhere. 

 (When I say my body I refer to the one I had been renting

 for many years until recently.) In the past everything was

 divisible by two. People would wait behind a wooden fence

 while a river of grass swept by. It was either noon or night,

 never in between, and most objects tended to be either blue

 or green. The sky was a huge lens through which the sun and

 planets and stars were magnified. Stone towers would 

 perpetually deteriorate, and streets would trail off aimlessly

 to the south and east, into the sea. My concern back then 

 was the amount of paperwork required to document all this. 

 Each day I would create a small chart where I would insert

 certain private symbols whose meanings I would guess at.

 The sun would tilt on its head, trains would travel 

 backwards, and I’d return home to my perch on the hillside,

 beside an easel. Sitting up there, I often saw ships laden with

 pine cones and red leaves to be applied to skulls of thinkers

 in the grass, and these visions lent elasticity to my

 temperament, allowing me to handle new events by calmly

 outfoxing them. Complications did not fail to ensue. For

 example, once as I was writing a poem similar to this one,

 a small animal darted across the page. I say animal but note

  a human animal. Despite my training, these were my

 immediate feelings: aggravation, annoyance, discomfort,

 disgrace, a sense of oppression, destroyed happiness, 

 inconvenience, indignation, insult, mortification, outrage,

 vexation, wounded pride, mental anguish, humiliation &c.

 Well, I think so then and I thought so still. Yet as of today

 my eyes have learned to avoid what they project, and so I

 follow their lead, focusing on an absent center, so to speak, 

 taking that center to be the thing that one day will envelop

 me, save that I know this to be false––a false idealization–– 

 like a pen or pencil gripped tightly in the fist, stabbing the air

 with signs that know no pretense outside of that which

 makes them intelligible. Lights flash east of Opportunity

 Rocks. Most of what remains gazes up at the hazy patch atop

 the night sky, until certain spells leak down like assistants 

 sent to make a task more difficult, plucking out spines of

 light for dark illumination. Is this what I came here to see,

 this thing that once lay beneath my feet, in vaults of 

 equanimity, its soil exchanged for what I’d occupy, 

 instinctively, in a drone of disappointment? Imagine that 

 I’m speaking of the pain I’m feeling in such a way that you

 feel it too; and yet I don’t feel anything. I’d love to be part of

 what you’re part of, to enjoy some poignant dream as it sighs

 in your ear. But I only feel a transcript of real pain. And yet. 

 Try not to put it in words. Eventually I’ll know when

 something has been left out. Is what necessary? I take a 

 short trip through time to find someone whose wings have

 grown sheer or at least impressively faint. I listen to dead

 voices argue beyond what I can make out, their sentences

 rolling to no other purpose than to coax remote things into

 view, even though they fail to maintain interest, and serve

 simply to punctuate the long night. Yes, amazing. For here

 on earth seasons are careless of speech. And there’s no

 recompense without injury. Nobody knows where they

 stand.

the passage

see it in mirrors

a mirror can you look out.

The forcing of myopia

glass windows.

 

It is with his mirror he waits, thinks,

“is there such a thing

 as normal when I am 

a person, people have teeth,

and I am not entitled to them?”

 Just wants teeth to not 

 hiss when speaks, so can

be heard, understood.

They say you will

 die anyway, what need 

 you teeth for—to atone,

to whet a blade for carving?

 

It is with his mirror he shows  

a creation: thirty-two gamepieces,

and a board. Carved of soap,

dyed with pen. 

It is with his mirror he counts backwards,

 inducts backwards,

 comes to the chill

 that comes of it.

It is with his mirror he sees a nick

is closer to him

him as a blanket

hands, fear, everything else  
that adults cannot see. Confection  
across the housetop – do you think  
they have kids? Here’s what it’s like  
to come from a sugarless world.  
Now I migrate between cavities, thread tongue between  
lips, hear screaming  
down the streets. I promise, invisible  
people won’t chase you  
down the streets, if they have kids,  
anyway. There’s been a heist  
at the art museum – is it the immigrant?  
the child? the security guard? None  
of those, really. I can’t roll  
the Mona Lisa into my backpack  
or conquer the world. Even spaceships  
are made of earth-metals. I wonder how many lies  
can thrive in one town. They die  
away, soon.

              for his use of that naïve ability to reinvent

or be swayed such that  
beginnings happened  
              everywhere and always for him,  
              happened as each flees her own enemy. . .

Despairing of his own  
inner construction  
              he prolonged himself, not so skilled in self  
              -destruction, feeding *sterilem*, futile, *amorem*,

love with his own  
destruction or hope, sperando,  
              *nutrit*. What patina of desire (of care)  
              so often unpolished her skin

that skin morphed  
into bark  
              with arresting varnish, while she stood  
              wounded and rooted to the earth,

and she unmoving,  
became the pivot  
              about which unreason willed the act of turning,  
              dependence made mechanical and fixed,

reflexive even. I am  
left to wonder  
              will her foliage survive with his death  
              or will it fade along with the calculated forms

on his forearms—  
artistry, or, willingness—  
              perhaps his lyric or quivers (in death)  
              habebunt, *will have*, her still. If not,

perhaps in death  
he might  
              render her in alabaster not laurel  
              with sharper touch and blunter brambles

and perhaps then will I mourn.

"
will not come back,"
The jet-drone of the river

      is deafening, shocked metal

 on sheet of black glass, the rotator

  

      a shriek of rattle-heat, power 

 into motion, limbs blown

      back. High above, flock of shrikes, 

  

 dark ornaments in branches

      leafless, bleached—

 a botched dividing, scrawled

  

      before winter, before

 freak fractals of snow, 

      before the fracked earth

  

 shatters far beneath. 

      I am but factual. Higher,

 in the black, unblinking 

  

      light of actual aircraft, of flight

 quiet as vectors. But up there nothing 

      moves: is it Venus, is it some star’s

  

 last siren, the workday over,

      compression over, light’s

 factory-whistle and called up years ago

  

      I am with you flying on aluminum wings 

 of no one’s making, black cows like rivets 

      gridding the brown field below,

  

 ice sheathing spiked turf, 

      sharp-tip, stalk, flat-feather—

 from soil these thousand beaks 

  

      hissing. We enter an eddy

 of cloud, the world

      whitewashed away,

  

 as outside us the hum grows,

      pale, hard, coiled,

 like a goiter in a bull’s throat.

  

      And is it in me now— 

 muttering, all sides

      the heavy, engined river,

  

 a hand dark as thirst raw

      on my tongue,

 when I am numb, when I

  

      am held down,

 when my eyes blow

      open: again the nerve the startle 

  

 the lurch of lift-off.

"
the last of winter,"
Sometimes, to avoid sadness, I ask 

 what I will think 

 when I know I am dying. 

 There, an orchid blooms

 and wilts. I wish 

 I had loved more people.

             Winds, preserve the shape 

of me, turns I make

 in the dark. I steer 

 thoughts through forests, 

 leave freight behind 

 that warehouse where my friend lives— 

 drawn into pages of directions, 

 his light-pencil. In his eyes, 

 traces of words: gray, faint, edgeless.

             They are for me. 

 Lay them out on the motionless

 river, walk with blue flame in mind 

 and give my friend my hand.

      by: I get it

       overtakes me  

        

  in her leopard coat.

       Angora guy  

        
 
 sweeps up his zone.

       A river  

        
 
  slides behind

       the palms, and the sound.  

        

 I tune it all out

       too, each getting  

        
  
 a rush in. I get

       the feeling grows.

       to cross,  

        
      
now, to turn

       the one-way.  
 
      
   
Not memory:

       I wear the jacket  

        
 
 new, hand-painted
 
       blue. All over  

        

 it was like:

       always meet

       -free pomade.  

        

 Few wear gloves

             He swayed  

        

 as if he had me

       with his traps.  

        

 It was just down

       to his face.  

        

 When I inhaled

       the air of him  

         

 I felt as if

       I’d only know.  

        

 He was sweet

       when he talked.  

        

 His mouth closed up.

       Orange pullover  

        

 and a cling job.

       I came away,  

        

 not even changed

       by the ripeness of his lips.

             In that office  

        

I saw a plant

       nowhere else  

        

 became its own

 a window,

       so couldn’t  

        

 let in a wind,

       couldn’t upgrade  

        

 the moment to

       its movement as  

        

 I would have it:

       my body, proven;  

        

 the plant, hanging

       up and

             shaken.  

        

 It was like snow,

       unexpected.  

        

 Temporary

       yes, but there  

        

 I go, into it.

       There are beams

 is some bird

"
the clew,"
In the ninth year,

 a high, bright room

 received the secret wheel.

 Outside, near the sky,

  

 a tangle of trees,

 the sound of sea.

 The spinster,

 her hands showing 

  

 wet, bloody with light,

 shuddered.

 Beneath her weight,

 the stool was still.

  

 She dressed the distaff,

 hairs hanging off

 like cornsilk, unspun—

 a pale, worsted pistil,

  

 which she twisted

 into tufts 

 of fiber, pinned

 to the spindle: speed 

  

 made a swatch 

 of her fingers, 

 braided, unbraided—

 almost touching

  

 the warming thread.

 Being lulled,

 I looked below

 to her naked feet:

  

 to where they beat

 time against the treadle—

 patter-pattern

 without sound.

  

 The wooden machine

 sloughed off the skein.

 I bore it to the basin:

 crushed cochineal,

  

 incarnadine.

 Dripping, it dried,

 caked with color

 like bloodcrust in hair—

  

 I evened the line.

 Slowly the twine

 whispered and wound:

 a sphere.

  

 In this way 

 I gave you 

 a light burden

 to carry unclothed

  

 into the tunnel—

 you will want

 to find your way back.

"
something evil is out there,"
  
That’s what the leaves are telling us tonight.  
Hear them panic and then fall silent,  
So though we strain our ears, we hear nothing—  
Which is far more terrifying than something.

   
Minutes seem to pass, whole lifetimes,  
While we wait for it to show itself  
This very moment, or maybe the next?  
As the trees rush to make us believe

   
Their branches banging on the house  
To be let in and then reconsidering.  
All those millions of leaves suddenly quiet  
As if not wishing to add to our terror,

   
With something evil lurking out there,  
And drawing closer and closer to us.  
The house dark and quiet as a mouse,  
If one had been brave to stick around.

"
ghost fishing,"
Hand over hand, fishermen hauled cod, haddock, \
flattened slippery silver against drying walls.

Below the lichen sea-cliff – a ghost fishing \
village. Huts arc around the black pearl cove. 

Along this coast every boulder repeats a story: \
Kerling implored her husband, out of earshot,

“Don’t leave me stranded at the ocean’s edge.” \
The trout bundle on her back slowed her down.

I lose track of mine as the winds pick up.  \
Witnessing the sun at daybreak, she turned to stone.

The fishermen threw dice of walrus teeth. Snake Eyes. \
Last night, by a fire, I lost every round.

Inside the rock, spirits bellow to escape. \
Like herds of stallion, waves stampede the shore.

Buffeted by high winds, I hear his shout, \
while beneath, shoals of quick fish ghost the depth.

the next generation,"
In the United Federation of Planets 

 pain 

   is not gone

  

 In that Federation we still have memory   

   And it has not brought us down yet  

  

 in the United Federation of Planets

                 

 we have abstracted away location

 We know no place               

                    There is none. 

 Where we once were, 

  

 we have abstracted away language, 

    we have stripped off our zippers, 

 we have found wisdom. 

  

  

 And on the Starship

    swiftly a god         among men he walks consider                    it

    *walks*      commanding the ship voicewise    chainwise      anticipating

    counteraction, action the sweep of his stride.   This is Lt. Cmdr. Data. 

  

  

 Let me remind you that he is trustworthy. Though gendered Data slick haired 

 is stable. He is interface and rationale and execution. 

 Let me remind you that we have beaten our televisions into agricultural implements. 

 And to put *this* TV show in context: Let me remind you: Bursting forth 

 like a time lapse flower: *Comes the knowledge that this kingdom will come to us.* 

 We will abstract away hunger. There will be a season for every thing, 

 time will turn each moment and bury it after. 

 There will be a way through. There will be a number for every day, 

 we will call to our gods still insistently but less urgently. 

 We will hurt so much but pain will not be execrable. We will trust our machines to hold us, 

 we will be able to afford to be careless of our genders, careless of our clothing, of our needs, 

 we will perform the manners of the past and we will seek out new life and new civilizations 

 and *walk* without location without appearance -- we will feel the counteraction 

 swinging back to meet the action 

 even as we are the action -- even unto the dusk aboard a starship, 

 even through the night watch, the bent shoulders of hurting friends when we don’t know how to help them, 

 even unto the return to Earth, the memory of what you were and the process by which you were changed, 

 even unto the death of comrades children parents lovers, even forgiving, 

 because if a MEASURABLE CHANGE has occurred then there is a beginning and an end, 

 then somewhere somewhen we are certain of anything at all. 

  

  

                                                                 When

                                             the cold dawn lurches over an alien world

                                 I will lean my head on the chest of an android. Just for a moment.

           And then              we will see to the wounded.   

                               You may not know:

                    we have never been safe before.

     But in the 24th century morality will   burn

               like a warp core. 

  

  

 How do you do it, Android? 

 How, How to speak with steady voice, without pull to home or need for sex or need for anything to distract. 

 How to follow rule, to stare economics down. 

 How to find a path without place. 

 How to insist upon what you don’t need, or want. 

 How: an absurd ethics. How: search *as though* in need. 

 How you changed everything, loose-limbed and striving 

     and clear-eyed ---- 

 How can you live perfect, 

 Data Why don’t you go to your quarters and just sit and stare?  

      Small wonder you have hoped to acquire our imperfections -- Data 

        your love

        is plain to see. 

   Lt. Cmdr. Data you have the bridge. 

 Do us proud.

"
sarcophagus,"

My grandfather burned fires when we were kids  

down by the lake in a structure he made  

from stacked stones, the ash  

so soft and powdery, almost white.  

There were burnt shards of birch  

cracked and black as pieces  

of a sarcophagus. You can’t witness your own death,  

I remember someone saying in a seminar  

while we were discussing a Celan poem  

in which the speaker is digging  

through the ash. It was a Thursday,  

I drank a bottle of mineral water with Ronald,  

sun on Holbeinstraße, sun on Morgensternstraße.

 Was it noble,

 The bitter austerity of desire

  

 Opposing

 Viol to cello, rampant to redoubled

  

 Free animals,

 Phaedrus a litter of souls coupled

  

 Eternally?

 There was a hillside farm, a steep one. I saw it.

  

 It was slow to

 Perish, floating in a mist of white bees.

  

 Then later,

 My face became strange to me.

  

 The world also.

 Charioteer of wounds and bleeding,

  

 What herbs might help

 My dead beneath the bright wheels of thousands

  

 Of you? Wild thyme

 Was a man once. The upshot and noon inclined

  

 To apogee,

 The higher still as early Magdalene.

"
at the estuary,"
Eelgrass flowing from the surface of the ocean

 like the sea’s aqueous mane,

 threaded gold

 waving at each swell of tide

 now and then

 separated as though by fingers—

 or like fringe, on the blue-green silk of a scarf

 being shaken out.

  

 It is hard to think of the time

 when a hand, puny and limp,

 will no longer be able to hold

 

 a comb, or a new stem;

 when hair thins and in clumps

 falls, and something to have

 been proud of once is lost—

  

 Like the old egret who stiffens

 at the lip of the estuary, eyes naked

 and large, bare head and neck turning

to salt, river and air meeting behind him.

They tell the phone not to worry,

 they lock up the doors.

 Then, they tape mouth of the mailbox shut,

 thinking: who would write? There is nothing

 to write home about.

 The address is hard to remember.

  

 On weekends, they take walks.

 It helps them

 stay young, they say, and they forget

 what they meant, where they were.

 The house breathes out,

 the window rests its head 

 against the mountain

 they are climbing, opens up, swallows.  

 The nearby church rings its bells for dinner 

 and they eat bread on a bench.  

  

 She cooks by a dictionary.

 He watches television, grows a beard like a newspaper pile,

 he speaks very little. He throws the leftover pages

 at the cat. It walks away, its steps

 are stamps on the carpet.

  

 They go to sleep still dressed and with the radio on.

 It plays sad songs, then good ones,

 then the news, then it listens

 to the raucous laughter of late guests coming in,

 sitting on the upturned chairs by the table.

  

 After they leave, the window is unhinged 

 and the mountain

 can leap out again.

 Where is my cloudy crown,

  

 my wreath of cotton? Garlanded body,

  

 I am entitled to more

  

 than downy dresses filled

  

 with seeds. For before the birds

  

 nested in my chest,

  

 rainwater fell from my face.

  

 I was not numinous,

  

 I was entirely clear.

  

 Now milk runs from me, for the birds

  

 to lap with their little tongues,

  

 for the weedy dandelions to wash in.

  

 Every recess preened:

  

 my part to play the princess.

  

 Now I am entitled to make

 that you could whip through it

Let me begin. I am 

 a Grinder. Bones are what I grind. 

   

 I come from a long line. 

   

 And I haven’t spoken recently 

 to a child, but 

 I remember 

   

 childhood well – 

   

 remember half cocked, livid, nowhere to climb. 

 I mean to come on strong; 

   

 maybe we can get acquainted here. 

   

 You can’t know a man until you know his profession. 

 Will you get to know me, boy? Will you 

   

 walk with me while I explain 

 how to grind an Englishman? 

   

 In my work 

   

 I don’t use many metal tools 

 save a knife to ease the husking; 

   

 instead I push my hands 

   

 at what-was-flesh, unrigging it, 

 at huddled masses of unincorporated cells 

 and through fluids. 

   

 Where at first they are dead bodies, tangent to my table, 

   

 when I’m halfway through they carpet it 

 and run apart through its grooves. 

   

 And then the grinding of the bare bones. 

 And then the baking of the white meal, 

   

 alchemy! born 

   

 into bones into 

 bread I come (from a long line) from my workshop 

   

 stained 

   

 with no remorse Jack 

 I am tired though 

 and a Grinder is what I am; 

   

 when I go to church my body 

 is loose lost fumbling in the blind pew. 

   

 Still you don’t know that my mother asked for no husband, 

   

 and raised me up in this tall thin house; 

 suckled me in the nursery down the hall, you must have passed it. 

   

 And I chose to walk the church with a ruddy girl, 

   

 purple pink and dust her skin - 

 but you’ve met my wife. You clung to her 

 breasts like her own babe, though I think your thoughts were less than filial. 

   

 But you will never know her, never 

   

 work in her as sunrise works in night, 

 as my grindstone in bone. 

   

 Jack, Jack. 

   

 I still remember - it’s not easy to forget - 

 my mother’s motto, passed to me: 

   

 fee, fie, foe – 

   

 meaning first 

 the holding of land 

 second the cursing of lovers 

   

 and third, one on whom you’ll have to set your sight, 

   

 someday, Jack, who will 

 want you gone.

ask,"
I hide in the family woods and  
wait for it.  
Brother and Sister,  
Ask and Embla come

to the edge.  
 I was born from driftwood.  
I made myself  
 a thrush— 

 the song is smoke over the fire now.  
Aspens are charred limbs.  
 They are abstract.  
 Brother and Sister set this 

 I hold the veiny leaves  
 falling blackened to the dirt.  
 Impress them in my palm they come apart.  
The trees contort 

 from heat, they  
 groan—the branches scribble furiously and  
I am separated  
 in the burning. Plumes float over. 

 Now I recover form.  
 I walk the limbs and am forever forgetting  
what was my name  
Life or zest or Leaf or Lifprasir

 

what was my detail-soaked skin—  
Not this  
 the convulsion didn’t save the other  
half of things. 

 What was here  
 before they came through the unveiled sex of  
the sky and left fire  
 for small things? 

 Ask and Embla,  
 Brother and Sister made  
 a perfect forest.  
 It is perfect. I remember my limb.

cypress scepters in the rocks paint green water,"
Cypress scepters in the rocks, paint-green water 

 crept like shadows about our feet. Swallows 

 ricocheting overhead in aimless cursive like the 

 accident of evolution, the calligraphy of the 

 wind. An evening is like a postcard so easy to 

 cherish. The easy memories. The familiar 

 grooves, well-worn, my vision slides into. 

 Where are those buried ones, the dusted with 

 forgetfulness? There, the untrodden soil 

 unstamped by the wheels, still loose about the 

 fingers. The time I was nine I told my parents 

 every once in a while a moment comes and I 

 know I am really alive again, I exist and I know 

 it and it is as though I have been unaware all 

 this time and there arrives a second so vivid 

 suddenly and they said are you okay I get taken 

 to the hospital they sticker wires to my head and 

 told me sleep why couldn’t that be beautiful. 

 Why couldn’t we resist. Wherefore did the 

 anxiety arise like dew, indiscriminate. You 

 couldn’t forget this now, though the spines 

 would crack like whips and the spells would 

 pass and the results were inconclusive and we 

 all just lived with the symptoms, symptoms of 

 nothing like your fabric flowers. The 

 arrangement we outlived. The water we could 

 not, the fire we could the scissors we could not, 

 take me those geraniums break me the cassettes. 

 Slurp me like a spool and pin me by my neck. 

 The flowerbeds, the furrows were ordained.

took a piece out   
of my side and

smashed it   
and diffused it through

the hole in what   
had been my side

beginning to see   
myself though   
faintly still just

catching at   
myself. I

was dust. And   
distance, distance

descried by   
dust. I am

no longer together, I   
said, perhaps I am

free. And I

ignited then.

Some parts I

remember. For   
example, when I drew

out from bleared dark   
alive my shape, alive

how it trembled   
dark to

pieces. Later, how   
my many bodies   
swam together,

silvering. And I   
remember the stitch of

dusk, the dew

that rose to meet   
my instep arch. The first

time I flew. The first time   
I was afraid.

3.

I have given   
 the last of my

dreams away   
to the separate   
animals. They

do not know me, who   
 am them. And I

do not recall

building this city, its   
 black water blooming

on its walls. I must   
have placed one

stone upon a stone,   
and then another stone

upon a stone,   
the dust motes as I

did it crying fool, and   
 crying star, crying

let go, let

go, and then just go,   
and then just

i stiffen again,"
I stiffen: again a shift,

 a shuffle somewhere

 in the darkness,

 impenetrable

 as the guillotine.

 The scaffold collapses

 into a bulging jaw

 sputtering against

 the shut. The heart

 is a muscle. Alone,

 against the drawbridge,

 my hand, wet with fog,

 slicks over the steel,

 and the big bolts

 resisting rust. Lift,

 and the rain

 folds like hands retiring

 into applause, and

 your silhouette disappears

 like a question

 into a question mark.

 As if anyone could be

 lost, and permanently.

 A candle spills through

 its wax, as the buildings,

 slowly, fall into a cloud

 which appeared as if

 to catch them, but, in

 truth, held nothing.

waltz emporium,"
That the sequelae of  
 such love has no  
 such effect can’t change   
 a bit where here  
 we are in this  
 coarse mood swing’s doldrums.   
 Tense is the season  
 where time usurps a  
 ginger snap, tachycardia enlists  
 the wrong man to  
 the job of whatever  
 job this really is—  
 a flank of venison  
 that outputs offshoots erratically   
 in tempered limb drop.  
 I fake back pain  
 and conceive of highjinks  
 suited to the rondure  
 of a crystal lapis  
 conference umbrella. There, love,   
 the park menu awaits.  
 Chilly denizens of fairy  
 bedtime stories do breaststrokes  
 in the heat of  
 fair espousal, gender removal,   
 plus and minus bargaining.  
 You must not love  
 me now nor ever  
 again says the creatine  
 injection with suave inflection.   
   
 Denuded for the evening,  
 suffering Bell’s Palsy, honored  
 by the draping hard-on  
 in the wind’s backtalk,  
 we settle up our  
 score and make way  
 on immobile yachts high  
 above the derby tides.  
 You move with prolix  
 spasms, inflated misdemeanors, even  
 a ringlet of pewter  
 that you place in  
 glass ashtrays for mother.  
 Today and tomorrow are  
 not polyandrous—in fact  
 suffrage comes in bins  
 on liners from token  
 deposits of a rough  
 Neanderthal mandarin. Oranges. Stencil   
 stashes. Sigh. Exhale. Scoop  
 the muscle tissue contraction  
 that has too its  
 Indo-European roots—we  
 all do, you know.  
 We all do. Yet  
 love has channeled the  
 age’s decorum into a  
 rare late-hour affect.  
 Pudgy bottom trawlers, all  
 of us and them.  
 When was it one  
 first heard the spray  
 at the back of  
 the throat that clicked  
 its graceshaped cap in  
 some kind of rhomboidal  
 romp? I don’t know.  
 O, verily, I don’t.  
 BP has continued setting  
   
 out its continued commitment  
 to environmental restoration efforts   
 in the Gulf region  
 despite the company’s legal   
 challenge to the misinterpretation  
 of the settlement’s agreement  
 with the Plaintiffs’ Steering   
 Committee. Arousal. Keystone Light.   
 Flick me with the  
 teeth of your smile  
 in the patchy dust  
 rigger you call home  
 my positive legacy love.  
 From small denomination bills  
 a wad is born.  
 And, your Highness, to  
 my utter amazement’s grotesque   
 patience, at least $4  
 billion donations a year  
 await gas development plans.  
 It’s Labor Day, 1935.  
 A tropical cyclone plunks  
 down its bushy arms  
 in Floridian climes, alas.  
 A flood burgeons its  
 safe bet, breaks its

 in their casual historicity.  
 Fire. Tornado outbreak. Exploitation.   
 Silicosis at Coconut Grove.   
 Explosion in Texas City.

 You can keep stemming  
 the laundry lists of  
 American disasters privately, which  
 is to say morosely,  
   
 or you can do  
 so in this poem  
 and be judged for  
 it—rightly?—I think.  
 USS *Indianapolis* goes  
 down—near Guam—direct  
 action (military)—drowning, shark  
  attack, hypothermia, 879 people  
 taken. The conceit is  
 plain, now, it exists  
 on a plain now.  
 A plane called Now.  
 Part of the tragedy  
 of dying in a  
 tragedy is losing one’s  
 dignity, one’s right to  
 personal, exclusive mourning—a  
 myth, yes, but one  
 we’d like not to  
 have robbed in front  
 of our very faces.  
 Rubbed out, the smokestack  
 plantation mill burned down  
 in the mudslide with  
 surprising caution, the witnesses,   
 onlookers, townsfolk, germs. Considerate.   
 It’s time. That terrible  
 time again. The scene  
 in the movie where  
 they must go and  
 part—and we’re not  
 even really sure the  
 tenuity of their... Bored  
 people are cruel because  
 now comes the momentum  
 of last resort. Hell  
 and habitude incurred by  
 salesgirls with failed aplomb,  
 pulling, milling, mulling, pilling.  
   
 I try to get  
 you to talk to  
 me and prop you  
 up and stuff you  
 with projected imagined speech.   
 The charming part is  
 you do not speak  
 even then what I  
 want you to—and  
 this is called something.  
 Junior jurors run away.  
 The fact seems to  
 be, however, a bullet—  
 a heart attack, company  
 dinners, unrelated fifteenths trying   
 to begin the enterprise  
 quite. Too many call  
 this something—this resort—  
 I try to get  
 even then what I—  
 resilient green and shaky  
 the lives lengthen custodial  
 bliss, worthwhile forays, unsaid.   
 Like the Jewish homosexuals  
 in Proust, we were  
 poison-ivy heroes, forgotten  
 on outer limits, played  
 badly by cameo Demerol   
 memorials. Is it right  
 for the dim vision  
 before me to salute  
 the end of my  
 qualities with a glass  
 of gin? Sometimes, your  
 voice, an imitation, a  
 thing said, a point,  
 is enough to let  
 gentle nature have its  
 most ungentle way. The  
   
 thriller is ending.  
 The thriller has ended.  
 The thrills are gone.  
 Most profound and subtle sense   
 be with me, tonight—  
 my love has evacuated  
 their sentimental fluids in   
 borrowed clothes from another   
 generation—one I hear  
 about so often, never  
 see, and this makes  
 me very lonely, depraved,   
 abject, foregone, a wasp  
 and wisp and gasp  
 with lisp. The cusp  
 of my love is  
 love, I think. A  
 kind of Calvinism in  
 reverse, if you think  
 about it. Love, goodnight.

"
kitchen in april,"
Little sister listens,  
solemn, to my tap  
of egg on silver-lipped bowl.  
It cracks the way ice does,  
lined as the palm of my hand.  
Just beneath the shards of white:  
filmy membrane, milk-colored.  
Stretches and tears  
like a mother  
to release the golden yolk.  
Never knew it was there,  
slick as frogskin.  
Never knew how easy  
it is to cut into something:  
in the grade school science lab,  
scalpel and blue  
rubber gloves.  
Organs like glass beads  
glowing in a veil of formaldehyde.  
I’m baking lemon cake for my mother.  
She loves the tingle  
on her tongue, sharp smell  
of furniture polish.  
Glassy wood of her first bedroom set,  
and I, nestled haploid within  
like so many white orbs  
in pink styrofoam.  
The whites drip over my fingers  
like spit or tears or breaking water.  
I can feel their aching,  
as I ached each month  
at thirteen, my body so empty  
it poured itself out.  
My sister holds the bowl  
in her bugbitten arms  
as I scrape batter into the pan  
with its grease-glow.  
She, yolk-gold, sun-gold,  
our small bright thing. Strawberry  
freckle on her nose.  
The year my mother birthed her  
was the year I learned  
of the eggs inside me.  
Little halves of would-be daughters,  
girls before they’re touched.  
Mama taught me their genesis,  
growing like grapes within me  
while I was within her.  
How baby sister,  
small enough to shatter,  
carries them, too,  
already,  
in her soft pink abdomen:  
womb within womb, echo of blood.

Unscrupulous, overweening comrade-in-arms.  
Regicidal regimental insectivore.

poem in the manner of self help with a moral,"
  When encountering an emotion

 they say you should visualize

 it somewhere in your body

 I feel this spray of wild dill

 barely hanging on in a light breeze

 but it clanks too   like a tool chest

 I like listening to the geezers

 play chess and discuss

 Normal Mailer novels

 at the tiled table with folded up

 paper under one of its legs

 The man behind the counter

 toting skullcap and attitude

 I don’t know   he’s interesting

 I imagine myself so

 inexact by comparison

 I like the idea that I’m progressing

 spiritually   that I can maybe

 sit longer inside the uncertainties

 surrounding meaning

 I sit here because it feels

 like I’m not in the city

 like I could leave life early

 The loud types at the table

 in the back make it clear

 the world has nothing to teach them

 I could learn something

 from them too if I paid attention

 long enough   not that I will

self portrait as road movie,"
  
 Given my hero worship  
 and your enthusiasm  
 let’s hit the road and  
 we can reshape

  

 American epistemology.  
 Of course we might ignore  
 active orders, turn and  
 escape, loose and free.

  

 But first open the trunk,  
 dig down deep, reach  
 your arm into the thing,  
 discover what’s of use, sunk

  

 to the bottom, and read.  
 There’s a new poem this  
 month, posthumous.  
 Take in the words. Breathe

  

 if you can hear them. Could  
 be a map, if you squint.  
 Tilt it at an angle,  
 shut your mind up good

  

 and tight, say it out loud,  
 scream it into the blistering  
 wind, think it. Think  
 it. It’s because we’re so sad

  

 that we left. It’s because  
 this ocean’s too close. It’s  
 not comfortable. It’s anything  
 but. Listen, please

  

 listen. Who cares if you’re  
 lonely, sick, depressed, a  
 poor excuse for citizenship.  
 When I look at you, for

  

 a moment I see myself

 transcribed the way  
 a mirror does it. All right. I’m  
 anything but. Or else

  

 we share a history,  
 harmonious or ugly.  
 A nightmare, a dream,  
 a hoax.

  

 So are you with me, are  
 you with me.

He went into the names and found the forms.

 He cut the long field low and let the light

 grid the grass. He brought two globes

 to compare. The uncommon color of the second

  

 won out. He would have peeled it, eaten it

 section by section, but he insisted he conserve

 the circle, because it is perfect. Skin and bitter flesh

 were not to part. The seeds were safe.

  

 He studied the perfusion. Then, in a tone

 like paper, said, “We could never have

 crafted this. Artery, capillary,

 fiber, and pulp. The rind like a halo.”

  

 He made him slice it to admire the shape. Yet when he held

 the sliver up to the sun, it blazed and burned their voice.

"
virgils aeneid translation of book i 1 34,"
I sing of arms and the man whom fate had sent  
To exile from the shores of Troy to be  
The first to come to Lavinium and the coasts  
Of Italy, and who, because of Juno’s  
Savage implacable rage, was battered by storms  
At sea, and from the heavens above, and also  
Tempests of war, until at last he might  
Build there his city and bring his gods to Latium,  
From which would come the Alban Fathers and  
The lofty walls of Rome. Muse, tell me  
The cause why Juno the queen of heaven was so  
Aggrieved by what offence against her power,  
To send this virtuous faithful hero out  
To perform so many labors, confront such dangers?  
Can anger like this be, in immortal hearts?

There was an ancient city known as Carthage  
(Settled by men from Tyre), across the sea  
 And opposite to Italy and the mouth  
 Of the Tiber river; very rich, and fierce,  
Experienced in warfare. Juno, they say,  
 Loved Carthage more than any other place  
 In the whole wide world, more even than Samos.  
Here’s where she kept her chariot and her armor.  
It was her fierce desire, if fate permitted, that  
Carthage should be chief city of the world.  
But she had heard that there would come a people,  
Engendered of Trojan blood, who would some day  
Throw down the Tyrian citadel, a people  
Proud in warfare, rulers of many realms,  
Destined to bring down Libya. Thus it was  
That the Parcae’s turning wheel foretold the story.

Fearful of this and remembering the old  
 War she had waged at Troy for her dear Greeks,  
And remembering too her sorrow and her rage  
Because of Paris’s insult to her beauty,  
Remembering her hatred of his people,  
 And the honors paid to ravished Ganymede –  
For all these causes her purpose was to keep  
The Trojan remnant who’d survived the Greeks  
And pitiless Achilles far from Latium,  
 On turbulent waters wandering, year after year,  
Driven by fates across the many seas.

So formidable the task of founding Rome.

"
plans,"
Their poor mothers’ white gloves on the waters.  Their desperate fathers, too.

 Their unborn children dressed

 in little unlaced shoes

 being read to from unwritten books in undecorated rooms.

  

 Shovelful of unfathomable. Crumbling castle of could have been.  So many prayers hanging from so many hooks.  So many unconscious flowers engulfed in hours

  

 swaying, saying pardon-moi, wearing

 fleshy halos, breathy crowns.

  

 And the butcher’s bloody little heaven

 in a hole.  The nurse unwinding and unwinding bandages upon bandages until

  

 nothing but bandages are left.

  

 A little gasp of laughter after that.

  

 An hourglass washed up by the sea.

 The soapy light of a late June afternoon. And the doves in the hedges

 like plans for the future.

  

 Those doves, such

 gentle, nervous guests, and—so polite.

  

 So let me ask you.  Now

 that we know what happened

 next:

  

 What did they have to hide

 and where did they hide it?

The sunset-red boy in his little canoe

 as his father stands grimacing

 on an opposite island: an aging man 

  

 in Crete who spat at me once, 

 then peered into his little salty pool

  

 with contempt that I turned my head away from—

 if only to find the next blind peasant

  

 lonely with his stories of St. Anthony

  

 (he overheard them from the nuns

 who passed through the island like clouds last July) 

  

 and his open palms, expecting me 

  

 to hand him the visible sun 

 like a hot coin from his youth

  

 spent wandering into and out of cathedrals

 and brothels, not understanding 

  

 the tombs he was kissing

 or the marble faces

  

 that watched him pleasantly 

 in his boyhood sleep,

  

 humming quietly to themselves 

 about the price of light in the current market,

  

 where the man who sells grapes 

 charges one-euro-eighty for every basket

  

 and leaves their seeds to float in the sea

 like miniature boats towards Alexandria.

 a manner of speaking

      against but regrettably

           through this break-black,

  

 over-interpretative reek,

      through this way of speaking,

           where *break* is consonant

  

 with *bleak*, through all

      that’s left for us. Along

           with this goodnight,

  

 which reminds me,

      there was no snow,

           is no snow this year.

  

 We cannot forget

      to consult the pond.

           Not unlike your dreams,

  

 the pond is a magic,

      the mirror of what’s

           fair, of creatures, of water

  

 cohering with water, as all

      above my head is how

           tonight now feels.

  

 Acrid clouds a black

      shade of bleak. I shift

"
basic problems in poetry,"
While I was not thrilled to be made a scapegoat I knew my 

 role.  The summer was more or less bitter than the fall.  

 Chairs creaked when angels sat in them.  The premise of

 their argument also creaked.  Along towards winter, hearts

 rose.  Something had gotten underway and was proceeding

 under its own power down the wet street above the beach.

 Motorbikes wove in and out.  Consciousness turned toward a 

 drop of blood shed while adding one more stop to the line,

 where thousands would never live.  I would never live there

 too, but my perceptions were bent from the start.  I couldn’t

 distinguish between identical worlds, nor did I understand

 how to dilute my own past enough to make it drinkable.

 Certain things that I read suggested this could be done by

 developing the proper attitude toward what might in theory

 transpire given sufficient passage of time.  But I don’t know

 what that is.  Things continue on in endless space, my good

 old captain said to me.  Meanwhile session one began by 

 revoking the law against breaking promises.  Egregious 

 examples were set out on a plain oak table overlaid with 

 butcher paper.  Crayons were handed round and then 

 deposited into a cylinder that appeared at the window. The

 session turned strange when one of the examples lurched

 through the room, calling the others names.  My right eye

 became distracted at the very instant I knew that this may 

 not really be the case.  So be it, lights flickered in the sky and 

 tall white letters shone brightly, as we easily saw for 

 ourselves. Out of them our futures could be foretold, and the

 things that would one day exist could be seen hiding behind

 the north wind.  There was nobility in these prospects, which

 varied depending on the character of the grain being roasted.

 Now was not the time that then was, but then no time was, in

 the manner of speaking of it.  And although heavenly 

 trumpets tendered three notes for each cake of phrase, I 

 knew Satan’s Kingdom had a hand in this.  Therefore session

 two called for a different approach.  I drew up a map that

 showed us here, where the black dots are, with our 

 destination being there, at the edge of the fir trees.  I traced a 

 fibrous line between them and off we went.  Maybe it was too 

 soon after death for things to have stabilized, because when I 

 asked about staff reductions your face turned blue.  As we

 floated along, a sense of futility followed us at a respectful

 distance, occasionally stopping to rest or take notes.  The 

 dark air grew thick, and our progress was stalled thanks to 

 *Preternatural Stupendious Prodigious assistance by the *

 *Devil given thereunto*.  A low theater crept up from the east.  

 I presupposed its existence before analyzing it.  Many times 

 I’d done the opposite and found myself carefully arranging 

 shadows while the objects that supposedly cast them 

 wandered off, pursuing whatever desires or whims were

 uppermost in their thoughts, without any consideration for 

 my efforts, save to ensure they were fruitless.  In fact this 

 became something of a trend over the years, until I counted 

 myself among those movable shadows, whose relative 

 independence only affirmed their contingent, gratuitous

 character.  So I assessed the current situation according to

 what depth of conviction I could muster about the judgments 

 to be made.  For example, was it sunrise or the middle of the 

 night?  We were wide awake, certainly.  And there were birds 

 singing.  But a sheet lay over the whole village.  Did it appear 

 then, as it does now, that the same question could receive

 thousands of different answers, and that we may as well have 

 been consigned to the nether side of some unknown planet 

 as to have been where we were?  This didn’t seem likely, or 

 rather there was no need to exaggerate the case or its 

 implications, even as the west wind swept through each

 tentative disposition proposed.  What felt clear was the sense 

 of a mental journey cut short by stupefaction––and by 

 open-mouthed disbelief turned despairingly toward an 

 empty corner of the room, which had suddenly enclosed us, 

 as the dim light from a sconce revealed a single, round object 

 at a distance of approximately five feet, either on the floor or 

 hovering just above.  No additional details were available.  I 

 called out to it; it called out to me.  Next door someone said 

 “Wait for the Face Man to come.”  Whether I knew to whom 

 this referred I can’t say.  How could such a problem be borne 

 without the elusive gauge of poetry?  Was there any way this 

 situation could have offered me a more refined sense for

 what was lacking, as I struggled to humor it into giving a hint 

 what the next step should be?  But there was no next step. 

 Present and future were simply abandoned to the insensate 

 devouring gorge.  Alternatively, the round object could have 

 been a kind of poem, like Wyatt’s “In Æternum,” although

 I’m adding that just now.  At the time I had no idea what it 

 was or whether it mattered for me to know, or even whether 

 its status as an object was worth confirming.  I did 

 nevertheless try to confirm it.  I understood X to be true 

 owing to reasons* a,b,c*, and *d*.  In reality, though, X was false, 

 for those exact same reasons.  The next day I stood waiting

 for a train.  Someone else was living inside me now, which 

 changed the problem completely.

problems worth having,"
At the corner of my eye is the most exasperating

 fringe at the oceanic hem of vision

 —the beveled edge of glasses.

 Most of the world is peripheral it seems

 to what falls on the macula  the fovea. caught

 in a single ?ashlight that seems like trouble. Look

 it’s clouding up again.

 The shadow of a palm is a lizard the wind runs back and forth

 on the handrail faster than the others.

 I think I could spend forever in the space of one Shef?era

  

 Lawn chairs drag their shadows back and forth daily.

 I wake up with pet clippers and the dog thinking

 it’s a bath so ?attens and slinks away.

 But I am not awake and the dog is gone for years.

 The incoming gold is doubloons and escudos and chain

 and all the pinnate and ovate leaves are nodding *of course*

 to the light wind from Mexico and its plundered treasure.

 Waking up with not so much as a pause in delivery.

  

 I think I am awake and I think if I sit

 in a new place I will see new things dancing and dancing

 as well in the banks of my glasses chrome and backwards.

  

 What has come onto the window frame is the depth

 of blasphemy everything ?attened by intent.

 The trees are cut-outs as if put together with a wrench and socket set.

 Carved birds strung before the doorway.

 But something solid is a problem worth having.

 We are such poor redeemers.

 Glass. A substance you can make a dog out of and two gazelles

 with a blowtorch and still see the whole coast straight on

 as it is now edged in spectra.

two birds flew around a branch,"
Two birds flew around a branch. 

 You saw this. You saw 

  

 one, struck, fall into what 

 is below and in that water 

  

 stretched by strings it seemed 

 out, feathers at strained 

  

 and calculable ages, still 

 in its geometry, fly in circles 

  

 to the edge. We are all different 

 with some people. In summer 

  

 you found Loretta 

 in a bush. She did not 

  

 recognize you. Where was she 

 going. At the edge, standing, 

  

 you saw the bird step--

 nothing is going to happen 

  

 to you--to where rippling 

 breaks step from reflection, 

  

 out of its depth and pivot 

 down to float back out.

"
the snare i ii,"
**The Snare (I)**

 

Please shut up. When I emerge wild,

 the golden lake over my shoulder,

 I will take into account the promise

 you entangled me in.

  

 1.

 Similar to the negative torso

 holding up the tree roots

 I ask you to be gentle.

  

 Everything will wobble

 otherwise               When you’re not here

  

 something crawls into the hole

 and doesn’t think.

  

 Patience is expendable.

 Go deeper with me.

 Break any final symmetry.

  

 2.

 I think this body is an instrument.

  

 I grow like a graft.

 It might be useless

 to try to place

 what stucco home

 sprung me fully formed.

 How often I thought

 of my network of parts.

 And I thought of yours.

  

 Wheeling we get married

 and I use my new mechanisms.

  

  

 **The Snare (II)**

  

 How do we know

  

 how to send the codes from one end

 to the other of the last sunken terminal?

  

 If I were to lie down and go to pieces

 I could imitate the echo in the marl.

  

 *** 

  

 A lord’s hand made me whole again,

 my corpse the fledgling map of the new world.

  

 A lord smiles like a turning wing

 and hovers over noon churning.

  

 All the parts were plain to see, the parish,

 the barnyards, veins and ligatures.

  

 They cover me with hay

 until I am gone.

  

 These locusts buried in the riverbank. They hatch 

 and fly further. They cluster with force,

 they eddy and course into my yawn.

He beheld her, in that mansion

                                   of hands, which made his—nimble, cultivated—  
                                   play with themselves as if reassuringly; and  
a smile, he couldn’t help it, a smile which would have been piteous  
were it not also motivated by a pleasure in profit,

                 slit his face—

 that such a creature, broken-  
backed with the burden of its pride  
                 and reeking of desire-sickness, that such a creature so  
      self-deceived, to think  
her grotesque pallor that of divine indifference,  
and her small black eyes the vortices of love,  
                should be beheld at all, that she shouldn’t vanish into her own  
unreality;

 

                 and he—painting her! who had fooled  
the birds with his delicious de-incarnation, he  
                 masking her unreality with extravagant mercies  
so as to make her real,  
and that his labor: to turn a woman sweet-sickeningly dreaming of herself  
                 into pure coherent light. He chuckled, 

                                  as though enjoying the work very much; she blushed to be looked upon  
and smiled at,  
and was so much the more revolting to behold

The essence of ugliness is labored ignorance.

 And so how ugly was he,  
he thought as he beheld himself in her blush and her maze:

 

                 overcome with sorrow,  
                 he was revolutionized by laughter.

 Anything, years, so I rolled it

 Up and went, went and un-

 A warehouse, a treatise saying

 Years of goodbye, it went on.

 In vain, I found it, a shore,

 Completed it and it died,

 Meanwhile sleep, you know,

 Drenched or silent, an ash

 Presented and taken away, years

 In that little wrong boat

 Gotten so that I might give

 With much and forever, nevertheless

psyche in bed,"
To the god. Tonightthere are no visitors. Stormclouds rise over the near mountains, beyond the finch-dense forest.For nine and ninefold nights I have waited in darkness, lulled only by wind-whine—unmoving, bedded, mind-whir muddles and buzzesinto body. From between teeth seeps fortha strange issue, dries linen-white, palerthan graying face. Untouchable.Sores collapse open  skin-strata, shallow basins, suppurated sediment. Nerve-sensed I survey the subsidence— does blood slowand flow around the wound? Tissue-silt crumbles, heats,as tubers sprout through the eschar, onion-stalksof bone, pungent. The blighted tendons. Each nighthands return to rub limbs with damp clothsof camphor, but I know my stench persists. Growswith each sullen moon, slow-flowing night-water. Brackish,blackening, the unrushing slough, breedinglike rancid trout roe, dug into gravel redds. Eelsdraw close, dazed. Residue of river, place where streamingstops. Tawny trace. Place where water slows, and flowis fallow. Have I fallen? My shocked knees molderand fold. My legs lapse. I will not leave. * * * At times I vision     a shaded window.The voice-veil with greened gaze     avers: no grovegrows on the hillock, and if below it     somewhere flowsap-slinks they are locked     in a rock-drum,deep and unrising. And what fate,     spun from a frayedthread uncut by the rust-knife,     will sphere me to stayif Eros does not come? * * * Bright: a begonia blooms. Yolky calyx whorlsbelow the twisted stigmas. Petalless yellow: the sepals. * * * A dream taskedto me: disorderof grain-sand and light.The love-wind, careless, carrying, knew little of chaff and seed, liftingbut what is too heavy. It came to pass. Dayplunged into the far massif,fell like shatter-glassinto the deepening forest. By my hands undertaken:you were and were.Another man might have beat the harvest, the hand-flail’s whiningchain, unsettling the scale-shells,then fan the thresh-pilewith vans of air-holding canvas, color of your hair,husk-grey. I was givenno tools. Raised my handsto the slats’ beam-slits, let your prayer-name rise.And from great height,over the mountain-shadows,the winds, thinned-warm, startled cool eddiesof dry-spooled air.Unweaving the grain,half-crazed scatter of field-fray, hazed, condign. Raincloudsfollowed the crossedcurrents, the streaming from the sky’s raised face. Were you there, restingon the low hay-bed,looking toward me as I left?Where I did not see, as a last breeze lazedin the wooden hold, the granary.Now what remains is only cold and golden. * * * A door deepens into the marble-mottle floor. My jewelbox, gilt-crusted, fills with gems, pale, opaque, vivecon, combivir, kaletra, truvada. The box, plucked open like a square-set string. Should they be bezeled, set in shallow-cupped gold, fastened to rusted ears? My arms are furred with sloe-blue molds. * * * The five-fingered god-hands dream.The thin indigo bird, startled, leaves. * * * Foot-whisper of a woman— You, with paper-scent fingers,within the bruise-black hall— Go where I cannot. Find.You, I know your hands— Your legs, they will take you.And once he is found I commandthat his stiff limbs be burned— String him up, dangle himwhere all will watch,where any who loves himmay freely go to weep— You will not find me there— * * * The second task-dream:to winnow thinsticks from the sharp-sliverarrows. Fine finger-workfor tips of small-silver:by feel to findthe breaking-downof browns. O were Ian arrow: freed from the bow-string to become vector—No: quivered into one thing. * * * As a pulley shakeswhen rope runsthrough it.  The bushesnew-bloomed, shivering,opening the meadows dowered with trees—heavy-leaved, hoveringabove, and the silent star-pulses, alive.Spring crawls intoeyes and scratches  its way out.When he comes,I almost do not notice his lightform, gauzed arrival,this low black  breeze-blow,the feathered airsuspending him above me—when he is nothere, it is as if he is not here."
official happiness,"
The cosmonaut returned to Earth said moonshine

 was what he’d missed, and wurst. He described

 space: weightlessness feels nice, there is plenty

 of candy stuffed in the hatch-flap, et cetera

 and the kids think you’re a hero. You distract

 yourself with streets named after you, men in stiff-brimmed hats

 glinting their teeth and their brass buttons, jangling your hand…

  

 those thoughts are off the record. Asleep on the ceiling

 of someone’s utopian dream, the poster toddlers warble

 encouragements from rosebud mouths: Glory

 To Breastmilk, To the Countryside Electrified, To War

 Bonds and Corn and the bravery of slow

 animals who have no choice. Glory to your mom

 and the soldier who opened her like a fat clutch

  

 and closed her up again, tenderly

 and left for the front before you weaseled your

 wet red way out. The pipes of your *Stalinka*

 are still leaking sour water from the birthmark spreading

 its tea-colored mold across the white. Your life

 will be busy and short and in the end you’ll lose

 sensation in your legs. Two hundred million friends

 will weep as newscasters gasp platitudes

  

 in the imperial tongue. The birch trees creak and sway,

 creak and sway above the grove where the young

 pioneers of tomorrow will carry your corpse

 carnations, whistling The Motherland Hears,

 The Motherland Knows… Your last thought: Korolyov

 patting the pure white fuselage lovingly, grinning,

 “The bastards, they’re recording everything.”

  

  

 *  Stalinka: the colloquial name for a style of apartment building constructed in the Soviet Union

 between roughly 1935 and 1960.

 ** Korolyov: Sergei Pavlovich Korolyov (1907-1966), lead Soviet rocket engineer and designer

 of the Sputnik and Vostok spacecraft in the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Space Race in the 1950s and 60s.

"
the accomodation of desire the pants poem,"


In all likelihood, they were the ugliest pants I had  
ever seen. Something with the soft brush of velvet  
but none of the right lay, huge hem with full break.  

Repeating from somewhere once, I said “corduroy”  
comes from *cord du roi,* cloth of kings. Obviously, B.S.—  
I mean, who the hell ever saw Louis XVI in wools?  
I picture him now in the pillory, in Levi’s, with his head  
all spent, tumbled pale in the basket like an unripe berry.  

I get pale-dry like that when I sleep funny. Those days  
always seem so muffled, like a watch wrapped in cotton,  
and viscous time contracts like a vein. Just like that, a day  
can fold itself into three hours, skim milk in coffee.  
The way it falls in on itself, then disperses. Now look,  

I’ll be the first to admit: it’s been years since  
I truly wanted something. A pair of fuzzy socks  
with individual toes, the texture and color of moldy grapes.  
So it’s not that I want you, this oil-slicked time, these pants.  

More so, I want the feel of it, tight bands of corduroy,  
packed like bamboo, Styrofoam-peanut seconds  
pressed just-so to the minute, the easy sweep of skin  

on skin. The feeling of everything suspended  
at once, like how the light seems to honey  
in Nan Goldin’s pictures, a looming sense  
of awareness coming into a frail body,  

like the husband walking in on his wife with the plumber  
while John Lennon intones the “Day Tripper” chorus.  
It’s such a steamy coincidence that I whip pan to the husband  
as the words come down like hail: *It took me so long to find out,  
and I found out.*  

In the end, I don’t buy the pants, and nobody bothers  
to fix the sink, which is a flood hazard. Which is to say,  
nothing happened, and no one cared about it one bit.  

"
the last poem,"
(For Sarah)
<br>
<br>

The last poem I will ever write \
will be like the first dream I ever

wrote down, when I was green like a lawn \
that did not know it was not the world,

I had gone to school and learned to be \
a little angry argument machine

and all the dittos slept in the blue \
light of filmstrips about the last war,

and we stood in line for the movie \
about robots who saved everything

with the help of people that taught them \
the essential importance of death

words they did not need to understand \
but only speak when they faced the gate,

then I went home and read the stories \
about Norse Gods and fell into sleep

with its unrealistic drawings \
and never woke up until we met

and this was the dream I remembered: \
mother and father were standing there

each wearing the faces of those ones \
whose benevolence cannot be changed

by actions or time, they are constant \
like a room that hides in an old book

you filled with wildflowers and sunlight.
"
atonement,"
And this is how we seek atonement. From its plastic chrysalis we unfurled

 a kite. A ribbon off the transverse axis dragged the industrial sand meant to offset

 the inward press of oceanic plates. The smallest, the narrow runner, holds the diamond by its belly and begins. The eldest stands anchored, remembering the dressmaker’s grizzled husband who fell off his motorcycle, his beard matted with wax. The eldest wraps the line round her palms and pulls in hard against the wind. We’re up,

 we’re up. The middle child stands in the surf and searches among the mollusks and wrappers for three unbroken shells she’d string into amulets.

"
may i be curious,"

*for Allison*  

All lovers feel like they’re inventing  
something. How else would we work  
out the kinks? I am in awe of your  
pussy. You said it appears like I am  
doing an inspection. True. True.  
I lift the hood. I study your anatomy  
of flowers and fruit. Mixing food with  
sex disgusts you. You hate cantaloupe  
and the texture of cherries. Once, you  
had a nightmare about being force-fed  
grapes.  Your eyes change colors when  
you laugh. There goes the secret life of  
green, witch hazel spells of black magic.  
You encourage me to *keep climbing* as I,  
a heathen hymn, teach you the taxonomy  
of touch. You, a table of plenty, show me  
how to paint by numbers. One is never  
enough. Two: my lips at your neck. Another  
two: the sound of my name—twin flame  
of your own. Four: your hands around my  
ankles. I present you with pansies and lilac.  
This poem is a form of praise and worship.  
In years lived, you’re on page twenty-eight,  
and I on page thirty-two. I hope that you  
survive me, I do not ever want to go without.

philadelphia,"
The service must have just ended, \
because the boys in their dark suits

and the girls in their skirts and dresses \
were spilling through the open doors  

as I walked home, Sunday \
in the late morning, wet light shining 

on the church’s stucco wall, the heavy white blossoms \
nodding from the rain just stopped, and the wet earth

surprisingly soft \
each time I stepped from the sidewalk to the bordering grass 

to avoid someone on the crowded pavement, and I was thinking how \
Brooklyn was  

nearly a year behind us now, each day’s long walk \
to the long wait for the late train 

to take me to work, the small apartment with the black balcony \
where the red birds gathered  

and one or the other of us sat smoking \
in the evening, or after we had argued,  

and were we happy now, I wondered— \
turning up the front steps— 

but hadn’t we gotten everything we’d wanted?

eel and water,"
Eel as   
if there is a

narcissus,"
The body near the screen tests itself, rests on itself, akimbo as windowcurtains pinned  
back, just a touch, green kimono cinched in pale rope, as one might flinch if  
pressed into soul’s glinting weight. Quick now, quick, those little lamps  
have all burned down, now your blue dune of breastbone isn’t  
seen except as remembered, and I will not sleep turned  
in here, will not sleep anyplace else than curled in  
streams panned with gold and no, this day is no  
such, pinching into its vise, steadies itself for  
night’s oiled blade, pillow-cold,

argo my argo,"


The mirror’s clubfooted,  
not me. Afro’s gone Medusa again.  

Every coil’s its own Hydra.  
I’m adventuring with a comb.  

The sink’s full of myths...  
The myths are growing...  

Everyday I find myself  
smaller with effort,  

my life’s light  
with every person who  

spoke of me. Last night,  
Achebe tried again  

and I nearly heard him.  
Ngũgĩ refuses these tones, says,  

*this music has the worst sort  
of oceans beneath it.*  

Besides, his ears  
are busy with real myths…  

*Being alive must be nice,*  
says the sink-basin, filling  

further with myths…  
I say, *abandon narrative,*  

latch on to landlocked  
home— forget ships,  

take planes! land with

with shore— forget ships,  
take planes! land with  

passport back to place  
without shore— forget ships  

for a day sometime on  
winter break, during summer—  

our only seasons here.  
My body’s a clubfooted boat,  

not me. One time I went

prow. One time I went

I say, *whose boat.*

bivalence,"
Far back before the sun  
made any sort of difference,  
and the icicles hung like knots  
in the light-grains that housed us,

I was unafraid to take your hand,  
unaware of the future we unzipped  
like a winter coat in late March,  
thinking not so much I was touching you,

but somehow touch, and thus entering  
some kind of experience. But it was remarkably  
just like any other object, for something  
with so many nerve endings.

Even your eyes, glowing in the halo  
the sun praises from the atmosphere  
in a still and timeless ring of dawnanddusk,  
spin through it like a pair of fading globes.

"
night hunt,"
Under the night’s maw the boar waits

 heaving black and bristled breath, night

 roils down the hillsides in heat spirals

 collecting in omnivorous dark the hours’

 end buffing night sounds and bating

 the mind’s early stillness. The ironwoods

 bend and whimper about bristling

 haunches rooting bristling roots of red

 clay white tusks between the shoulder

 blades of dogs behind a man borne down

 on scent wide across his broad back

 bulk of night cool on his thick neck

             Nascent light—here none—

 but the purpled hour like the dogs’ deep

 colored tongues still wet tremulous

 the boar still thrashing in the precipice

 raw gnarl of the tree vine and red flower

 the island’s gashes go boiling down

 its sides ashen-barked volcanic trees

 the boar barrels through the girls

 set on him their chorus of yells strains

 through the dark I wait the girls’

 shouts into the terse dawn the dark

 tree-throats relinquish the yawing

 clamor at the yellow dawn and light

 discerns the long ocean’s sweep.

"
bone,"
  Not a solid thing, like steel or a rock.

 Full of voids, the way a vault is capacity

 for what is to come, and what was.

 The passing of a person who has built it.

  

 In this way it resembles bone—serpent

 eating its tail, one half, osteoclast,

 dissolving the other, cells foaming

 from this effort. Bone-cleaver cleaved

  

 to bone. Though what survives is just the distal

 white form, a hollow—bone’s death

 masks—what awe that we make out

 of this brokenness a constellation: bone.

"
winter landscape,"

*A woman is / turned into a lake she is  
      secretly pleased.* Great blue herons  
are moving across the sky / and the body  

of this twisted oak its / arrowed branches / flung  
      in every direction / is now  
leafless / so that its outstretched  
      arms do not / run the risk / of breaking  
their own weight / *cold sweat poured down  

my imprisoned limbs wherever / I moved my foot  
      a pool gathered* / that this water could  
bruise me my voice / caught in bird-call I  
      want you to put me in the ground  
with my mouth open / and when we say earth  

we mean human  
      earth / foxes have no history  
transcripts / know not how their great grandparents  
      died / and who among us / records / the continual  

losses / it is lighter / to be fleshless / a beetle colony  
      takes three months to eat / a white dog clean  
like a hymn / say / *I will be taken* / knowing  
      the bones will remain.

rain and mountains,"
Sitting on a ledge,

 observing the landscape

 below, she admires

 the proportional

 beauty

  

  

 of the sycamores,

 spires, and greens,

 but the air smells ornery,

 and she is distracted

 by a vibration.

  

  

 She wants to wash

 her hands but cannot.

 All things might

 change but do not.

 Plagued by uneasy thoughts,

  

  

 she wishes she’d

 taken the drugs.

 It’s as if her head were

 partially blown off.

 Who will find her?

  

  

 The view across

 the valley reveals

 an electrical storm coming in,

 squeezing the clouds,

 tearing them asunder.

  

  

 Long ago,

 her parents nuzzled her,

 murmuring, My love,

 but now her eyes

 are salt-choked,

  

  

 and a fragrance

 blows from the river,

 as daylight topples over,

 darkness coming

 suddenly in the North.

 how brief in noon did you bend to the eyeworn field washed with the dirt of sunlight, hold your breath as if to harden, ungleam, end into leaf, but you did not and sniffed the burngold air you stained, and passed on, leaving the field attentive, opener, as if it were suddenly the absence complementing a gone body and the snow starts shh 

   

 *Fremd bin ich eingezogen,* 

 *Fremd zieh’ ich wieder aus* 

   

 A pace, a tread which says we will get nowhere but continue, a hymn living in the church of its tone, wandering, to fall exhausted into God’s lap

 * *

 *Nun ist die Welt so trübe,*

 *Der Weg gehüllt in Schnee.*

 * *

 In the snow, in the woods, with not much moon, there are no shades of sound but terraces of it, precise as how glass shatters, and the wanderer’s steps, having been absent forever, speak. An overtone of the fact of this heartbeat is a melody like a faithful translation of past hope into the inevitable present pulse which goes nowhere and is true enough as to seem never to have started, always to have measured its minor syllable, a dragged foot long, through the snowreadied field which waited for it, the road like an abandoned attempt at exactly this. And the thought takes shape

  


 *Ich kann zu meiner Reise*

 *Nicht wählen mit der Zeit*

  

 The way even this steamed mercuryline of song was long constructed by the cold, by the drying white throat of silence which oriented, at your steps, toward the hot black pupil of you. And what you give

 words to had just

 been said un-

 -translated, I cannot

 pick the time, then

 you were propelled

 up

 to speak

  

 *Muß selbst den Weg mir weisen*

 *In dieser Dunkelheit*

  

 But the way is already found and you sing to show the darkness a perfect darkness. Which does not lighten but keeps you a breath’s length from the world, where speech is. But farther, from the distance of music or the eye’s blackshone core, it is all unreal enough to be gray. But you find nothing. You dip yourself in brighter black so you will be lost and the same hand which mouths your words before you pour the hearthsmoke of breath into them will plot unfeeling the path you will feel.

  

 *Und auf den weißen Matten*

  

 Who hunted the deer whose tracks hunt and predict you

  

 *Was soll ich länger weilen,*

 *Daß man mich trieb hinaus?*

  

 Here there is no away to be driven. For passing your hand through the tones around black as through shades of water you pass through black again, so that black comes to be only where you walk from and where, you keep remembering, you are going. The farmhouse is an accident, the gold of its eyes glancing away and going out, a face, did you call for it? You cannot fix its gaze.

  

 That the modulation from minor to major is the most painful one. Achieved by wincing into surplus a pool which accumulated,

                                   unnoticed,

                                   to brimming,

                                   nightlong. The listener’s face is loose, open, and the eyes blacken and wet to match the dark or breathe in it, the cheeks hang around the set jaw of the minor third. And it expands and the listener cracks into an

                                                    instant of

                                                    diminuendo

                                                    of exiled sunlight. How much he smiles through. The pool spills.

There is no winter but she saved

 two pomegranates for me

 from the deer and the salt

 winds. They grew into the window.

  

 Each year there are more fields

 let go to seed. She cannot

 stop planting even as the green

 up and envelopes her.

  

 I must count each leaf, stroke

 each new moss and name each.

 I must sit in one place until

 I have named and kissed each

  

 thing and then I turn to the next

 in my orderly radius and they keep

 sprouting exuberant and I

 am weary of counting the wildness.

  

 I do not know the seasons

 any longer coming as they do

 endlessly or never: here I am

I’m really a fan of the rabbits, of slender ears  
of their long left ears, fickle, triangulating signals from the wind, beneath the bushes beside the large ferrovitreous cistern collecting dimensionless shadows of European attitudes. Now the right ear bends, turning toward ground the innominate blades under snow here.  
Now I’m really a rabbit, mostly dishabille,  
a shapka-ushanka with flopping ashen flaps above, bobbing below, my peculiar ears.  
Here I’m down on fours and my legs  
learn new syntax from the available experience of lassitude proffered by vernal narcoma.  
Now I’m not worried if I have stipend in backlog with which to purchase utterances of the coterie or nibble the ivory indices of semophones. Here weightless excuses sink into deep wellsand anchorites emerge from ochlophobia to diveinto the ice covered river intothe yellowmost layer of scaffold, of secondhand sulphur, down the clear river-torso, skimmuddied toesconjured by buoyancy stiffened by cold.  
Now, the rabbits are speechless.  
All these worries submerged in praise!  
As a fan, I’m curious by megawatts, stupid by cocktail;  
I chase with abandon. I kick in the snow, shoot up  
white hurricanes, flares reflecting frightened Andromeda. The warren, below roots and rubble under cedars, is too smallfor my biophysical exuberance; the undercarriage of trees disorients me.  
Now I’m here, and I will be here  
until it’s time to rub against the clock,  
against the changeover at the rotary. I turn sinuously, I accelerate out of lens focus,  
beyond the pointillistic boundary.  "

“Joint fluid,” said the physician, spilled \
             from a sprung seal in the ultimate knuckle \
of my left index finger, just shy of the nail, \
             and gathering there to a “mixoid cyst,” \
a substance also called “digital mucus.” \
             Once a woman with beautiful hands  \
said to me, “There are very few physical pleasures \
             without a little mucus.” \
But when this doctor with an expensive \
             lancet lanced it, there oozed from my mixoid cyst \
a viscid substance vastly more limpid than semen \
             or vaginal secretions.  It was like a tear \
wept by a fly-sized golden butterfly— \
             and when I touched the tiny glistening orb of it  \
with the pad of my opposite index finger, it clung \
             to the print’s whorls, and when I swirled it \
against the pad of my thumb I understood \
             my body will never repay me \
for the satisfactions I give it every day by moving. \

through every atom of my corpus \

of the dead white men,"
Because some of them crawled on broken

 hands and knees to save me

 with their poems.

  

 Because I was only

 wretchedness at the edge of an abyss

 of fashion magazines, and that

  

 trickle of water down the side of their mountain

 into my empty cup, which I refused to drink, they

 were offering that to me.  Because

  

 I washed my face in their blood.  Because

 I tossed my hours in their coffins.

 Because I was otherwise just dust rising off

 a lampshade.  My

 tatters in rags without them:

  

 A girl blinded by her own hair

 riding her bike somewhere—

 stupid, dying

 for want of what

 was written there.

  

 A glittering starvation, forgiven.  Willing

 to burn their hands for me

 to deliver it, burning

 while I denied that it was burning.

  

 I was like a child outside a cave of snow

 that had collapsed on her fathers.

 I laughed, wildly, for a little while.

  

 And then I screamed.

  

 And then I pouted.

  

 Then I grew older, and had to begin

 to dig my own pitiful little

 hole with a teaspoon to get to them.

The spud keyed up the ice

 like Tec was trying to chip

 flakes into his lemonade.

 That’s pretty fucking deep

 right there, he massaged

 from cheeks taut

 with the cracked

 shake of trees

 unchewed: not much

 but jagged beeches,

 stretching their necks

 against the settling

 cut of cold.

  

 He stepped slow

 through the flat snow,

 enough to cover the leaded gouge

 of the spud.

  

 Gotta cut some poles,

 he said, kicking a clean chew astray.

 That’s a big house.

 He fingered the painted hatchet.

  

 His hole echoed across the

 whited bog—long enough to get

 the dead-spruce poles down,

 wide enough to get

 a fifty pounder up. Diving

 his hand and wrist and arm

 into the black,

 it came back crystalized.

  

 Right there—that’s the channel to

 the feed bed over there,

 a snapped stick lump

 large enough for four.

  

 Tec pinched the springs in place,

 strapped those to the poles.

 Using a three-thirty here,

 a blind set here.

 Tec rapped on smiling

 green splint sticks

 in his oiled pack basket.

 This here popple

 is candy to them.

 He wired a chunk

 to the wiley trigger.

  

 The ice moaned deep and low,

 the pins, the masses

 leaned in, stared.

  

 Tec sets the toothless jaw wide,

 a gummy smile of rust,

 it slips into the water,

 nestles aside the muck.

acid reflux,"
The way my doctor goes about it  
seems to allude that anything is a well  
some distance from total drainage.  
It is true that my body has endless  
things to say to you who touch me  
through the sleeve of this day mist.  
The earth was made too vain to consider  
that any one thing must gones for another  
to preen. All of the parts of me keep  
reaching like mimosas for touch  
and killing themselves. In the last of my most  
hopeless weeks in Boston as it was slow  
wintering my only pleasure was to drink  
glass after glass of orange juice by myself  
watching what could have been the end  
of my life. But I don’t think I can ever  
be finished; I’m in love with far too many  
countable things. And there are all their names  
to learn. Whatever you say I’ll plant  
a thousand flowers to retaliate. Always  
you want to be special in your nothing  
but there is the pail of your body working  
against its own current insisting  
with unweary voice there is no end  
just water on water on water.

 from sand back down to it. We knit their manyed  
 peaks into the flame, a fire beating from our hands.   
 Its fingered blades. The isthmic strands we grip  
 that weave the hummock in. From heartring   
 dead. From younger rings that age in lockstep  
 round, proceeding. Radiate: the mice twitch   
 burrow into run. The smoke unfurls its plane.   
 The fires constellate, and lifting, dredge  
 those yawning pupils open on the sand.

 The one to one that touches in its bright makes many

 each pulsebeat measures. Each hurries from  
 that feathered mouth that hisses as it preens.   no   
 no  very bad and blooming  the sky gluts thick  
 and drops.  The what for whom sheer wanting sprouts  
 its limbs, appends and swells the objects in its reach.   
 It rises them. The hummock bursting upwards   
 by that bright, then bustles, shines and caves. The  far  
 and farther till the air sinks up.  The shadows   
 planted down await their fated objects in the clearing.

 *Note:  Spinifex is a grass that grows in hummucks in Australia. When the hummock ages, its inner circle collapses, resulting in a ring.*

   


"
la montagne qui accouche 1982,"
REPRINTED FROM THE 1982 SUMMER ISSUE

  

 Translated from the French by Robert Fitzgerald

  

 Une montagne en mal d’enfant

 Jettait une clameur si haute

 Que chacun, au bruit accourant

 Crut qu’elle accoucherait, sans faute,

 D’une cité plus grosse que Paris:

 Elle accoucha d’une souris.

  

 Quand je songe à cette fable

 Dont le récit est menteur

 Et le sense est véritable,

 Je me figure un auteur

 Qui dit: “Je chanterai la guerre

 Que firent les Titans au maître du tonnerre.”

 C’est promettre beaucoup; mais qu’en sort-il souvent?

 Du vent.

  

 A mountain mountainous in parturition

 Broke all the windows of a valley neighbor

 Who tumbled on the run to view her labor,

 Thinking a mountain in such huge condition

 Might bring forth Hell itself: a town: at least a house.

 The mountain was delivered of a mouse.

  

 This story, if I’m sober when I read it,

 Strikes me as somewhat tall, if not gigantic:

 Yet even for the most approved Romantic

 Its literary sense is clear: concede it.

 Think of the poet who begins his piece,

 “I sing the lords of night and the day’s release,”

 From which impressive pangs what issue do we find?

 A little wind.

 obscure the bank, waist-high, where the dock,

 that dumb, clean monk, has lost its red habit

 to the current, limbs scoured by microbeads.

  

 “It really ain’t that hard, you just loop the line

 loose around the sticky bait, drip the knot in

 your mouth, and cinch, trap wire for yellow

 perch, that what your mouth is for,” he grinned.

  

 And that was what he said. What this shored mind fills in.

 Reaching back, my hand is fishing for the true

 weight of his knife, warm, yellowed, and finds

 a phone, no bars, the hollowed waters

  

 parting. Hungry go those who long after fish long

honest in which not gently,"

Does it matter how festive it was, the setting out for far country,  
the horses, their chestnut flanks, their eyes the color of black basil,  
which is purple, really? Now just skulls where a face used to be,  
shameless, as in bereft of shame finally, each catching the snow  
gently but differently, the snow, and the wind scattering it, as if  

unapparent meant nonexistent. They say language has its own sorrow,  
but no word for it: does this crying out maybe come close, though,  
can we say it does, to have stared into the dark and said aloud, even  
if quietly, Who’s there? Anyone around? Panicking too late, as is  
the way with panic, the killer stumbles through woods and a snowfall  

that feels like ritual and a release from ritual, so that it also feels –  
at first, anyway – like being lost, but free. Beneath the pines, the two  
horses stood exactly where he’d left them untethered hours ago. Snow  
dusted their fine bodies. Nightmare. Nightmare Lifting. Their names  
swim up to him. I remember, now. Yes. Now it’s all coming back.

landscape with an aspen,"
Morning is stark over the contours of two hillocks. The slopes are trapped in slow folds of air bright as the glass of an unused photo frame. The air gathers reflections from the undersides of leaves that look like quieted skin in a room with the curtains drawn. The leaves stick to one another and to the bark of the tree that swoons into the blue space off to the side, following the rules of good composition. There are no clouds and the sun is not pictured. Neither is the procession of women that had just passed through here. They wore hoods and held out cupped hands. Their cupped hands carried nothing. Perhaps a bell tolled in the distance and the echo followed them. That we could never have known. But the women, the women – the creases in their palms were thin smiles.

ruth thalia writes to the poet,"
  today I heard the capitol catch

 fire     like a burning bush

       all I could see were ground glass and

 sun      it was the FARC   I assume  since

 sendero is dead even though homes 

 in Lima still shine in a myelin

 sheath    insects on their  backs

   under tearing star

       at  least that is what I 

 see   from here      like a million 

 trembling stitches on a floor rug    

  

  

       I can also see capitalism     DOUBLE 

 JEOPARDY    and the answer:   What is

 trite         ca-pi-ta-lis-mo     I can hear

     it is a white sphere   so smooth

 I want to stroke   with

 vibrating fingertips    string it  

 onto a thread    wear it like a cross 

 perched always between my 

 breasts     keep it moist    screen its golden

 eyes from  the stubbled capitol

 shifting between relapse and   remission

         viscous black splotches wave from

 silvery column      physicians have

 diagnosed     so I’ve been told    the

 ailment        confusion of self and non-

 self       and are beginning administration  

 of a cure          oh   why do you keep  

 pulling at your scalp          lab coats always

 reminded me of Miraflores      of Dracula

 of mountains of lime

  

  

 once I threw two handfuls

 at my face       stood at the center of

 the highway at the foot of my home

 and almost thought I felt

 my heart    beat white      tightroping

 along the yellow painted line   I walked

 in silence until midnight 

  

      to my left waves fell   silhouettes

 of piled trash became far red hills

 and the road smelled of salt and beer 

      alive       you and I   looked

 at the world sideways and

 missed all the shapes I now see

    from above and below

depression,"
Depression—it’s a public feeling

 But what if I don’t like anything as much as I pretend to

  

 Darling Darling Darling

 What if I don’t even like you

  

 The blue night with trees

 Everything told me to feel something

  

 And yet everything you said was a lie

 And all my emotions were for nothing

  

 Oh all they want you to do is cry cry cry

 Cry they say Cry

  

 The animal takes the shape of the spirit

 And the I is no I

  

 Hardly on the girl

 But why?

  

 I had two main ideas

 That I brought to the forefront

  

 But the ideas never moved the audience

 To laughter, to pick the pockets

  

 So I tapped a little peacock

 With the fiery tail

  

 Until no one knew what was there

  


Sadness

It’s a public feeling

 

So I cry and cry

And the silver moon goes shining

 

Thunder and lightning

Thunder and lightning

 

I woke up in mid-morning

 

And it was all chatter

Just thunder and lightning

I wanted to know there was nothing.  
I kept knocking. When I touched  
the door with my palm the wood froze.  
When I called your name you slept behind  
drifts of rain for nine hours.  
There was snow in everything I spoke.  
Your eyes filled with the green paralysis of  
trees, months of wind at our lips.  
Please don’t worry. The bell  
that once rose from my throat  
in breath below you blurs into the night.  
I have less than I had when I first saw you.

 For the sake of illustration I fall asleep and things change as

 I breathe them in, the walls becoming floors, the floors be-

 coming streets, the streets becoming fields, while various an-

 imals, startled, cautious, move warily up the hill and into the

 woods, where they revert to a prior state. ere are sometimes

 moments of calm arising in an imagination without the dis-

 cipline to embrace them. The animals all sense this. They

 stalk one another through the trees in order to demonstrate

 their most characteristic instincts. But these become detached

 from the bodies that house them, which huddle along the 

 circumference, or glide back and forth through small gaps in

 how they were made. Sounds fall to echoes, roughing out a

 zone where what one hears matches what one doesn’t hear,

 and adjusts to its shadow.

My left hand digging in my pocket. Three days ago a\
Chevy parked outside the garage, waiting for the stars to\
bleed into the ready ground. The clouds never rise: they\
film the skies white. My hand scooping the wind, shoveling\
light to make way. Then the mechanic, the shaking leg, the\
loving familiar pain. The truck coughs final. Every arm\
snapped—even young—heals slow. But we salvaged scrap.\
The heavy hand, the girl. Today, the new sky. The first seen\
cloud, the sun going quick. My pockets shrank fast. My\
father buried far, my tiny hands big. Sun’s coming, sore\
eyes. Don’t look yet.
"
on wet grass,"
*On wet grass *

 Coldness, the small knife splitting the bud,  
the wink of the shears cutting the hedge. The  
angel flattening its palm on grass, lifting its  
hand to show the gorgeous cross-tangle of  
morning, wet with predictions. The child’s  
mouth opening, the poppyseeds swirling,  
black wind-bound away from their red. 

 *On Anna Karenina *

 How delicately we use the word *ruthless*.  
The dancer wraps and unwraps this word  
round her torso like silk. And Anna’s body  
stretches onstage, neck tense, legs untender,  
train shrieking up through her spine, steam  
filling the throats of the audience.

 *On unrequited love *

 Pitiless line of white along the Scottish  
lake. Man throwing the split twig to the  
injured dog, the fissure in the water-rock.  
Two schoolboys with dirt-stained faces  
unbuttoning their uniforms. The smell of  
used-up flesh climbing the birch tree. 

 *On Nagy Diófa utca *

 The man with his cart sagging under plastic  
bags filled with rain. His pillow-case. The  
bookstore behind him, lit-up. The garden  
deep inside where sleepy children comb  
each other’s rain-wet hair. 



"
escape,"
**Escape** 

 

 

1.

It cannot be said—

 

to see it utterly absorbed

into the private blues of her clean eyes—

to feel it discharged, flushed away, by the ‘me’

she keeps hidden inside

the bathroom of her ‘I’—

 

Is it impossible to know her?—

Can I only purge myself of this immemorial ‘it’—

this phantom limb, this imperishable guilt,

this astonishing confinement, this self—

*my *self?—

 

No, I must speak—

if only to have a word of mine

plunge into the center of her will

and be forgotten; I am homesick,

 

homesick for myself.

 

 

2.

Our pale hidden hands, longing, guiltily

gesturing toward a greater cognizance of pain—

as if to misinterpret the matrix

of God’s suicidal compulsions

 

were to see a disk of vindictive love

fall from the sky and incinerate

the last punishable traces of *our *will.

Have I no tongue, no fingers, no eyes—

 

only ears with which to suffer the abuse

of infinite black doors

swinging open & slamming shut

in the flattened palace of the sky.

 

Black time rolls his negative dice through space,

as bells toll the extinction of the wild.

 

 

3.

Ricocheting like a siren in a block of ice,

your excitement settles, a kaleidoscopic veil,

over the soft warbling of her intent.

 

It is not, you suppose, unlike the hysterical dawn

retrieving the stars, one by one,

from the palm of your mind.

 

The injustice, the torn signature

of the absolute, drawing you shut—

She tiptoes, like a priest, through your secrecy—

 

Accused parrots

quivering in the black branches of her eye—

a ring of hazel witnesses poised to speak—

 

 

4.

A labyrinth of me’s

to confuse the course of you and I—

 

I do not dare, I do not speak—

pacing anxiously, like a faithful dog,

the shores of your invitation—

 

I do not dare, I do not do,

gawking at the world as it bends itself into a ball—

thinking whether a moment’s indecision

were better spent sheltered and clean,

alone inside the cage of my me.

 

No, it cannot be said—

 

to see it exiled, apprehended

by the petty judges of your foreign smile—

 

doused again and again in the oils of unreason—

and sentenced to the darkening waters

of lonely remembering.

 

No, I will not speak, and have

my every yes shown to be a matryoshka doll of noes.

 

 

5.

Sickened by the thought

of world masked by, and masking, world—

of some implacable creativity

miming destruction, a straitjacket of images

hurrying to restrict the mad twirling

of twisted limbs—

 

dysthymic jaguars or retarded fish

carried like sleeping children

to the door of insomnia—

 

Taking his face in his hands,

he thinks, Yes!, there is no greater joy

than that of never seeing myself,

of never feeling contained within

what, when barred without,

hangs the world in its greedy frame.

 

 

6.

The crippled girl walks when father shuts his eyes.

I watch with shame, and wait for her to fall.

You will tire of yourself, and still ask for more time.

 

I have been lazy and afraid, hiding from my life

in a nightmare of my self; letting thought,

like a crippled girl, walk only when I shut my eyes.

 

I have sat like a dog, and watched the empty streets—

the nobodies and nothings that time will turn to fear.

I will tire of myself, and still ask for more time.

 

Should turns pale, and could grows thin, and you cannot—

cannot forget and cannot begin, needing time, time to worry, and time to wonder—

until, crippled in your will, you walk with eyes that time will soon shut.

 

Have I courage to speak, reason to try?—

when she may laugh, or pity my crooked heart,

tiring of me, while I beg for more time.

 

An elbow on the table, the riptide of hysterical dread

sweeping past the stove—voices** **rise when faces fall away.

The crippled girl walks, and father shuts his eyes.

You are tired of yourself, still you ask for more time.

 

 

7.

Time, like God, hangs itself in the scarlet sky.

Without reason, thought descends the black rope,

 

Enclosing the world, for a time, in a mind.

The mind, a child, scrupulously imagines

 

That it is free, and arranges the night

In an austere array. Then, the mind

 

Forgets—the cell doors swing open.

It is as though some pitiless form

 

Slowly, like a fist, unclasps itself.

A procession of images

 

Exits the mind, the poor, inside-out mind.

Strangers with downcast eyes move briskly

 

Through the rain. The cold, homeless world.

Pain persists where thought from thought lies barred.

 

 

8.

The evening whistles, walks with his hunters through the sky,

my eye sixteen thousand bicycles riding blue out of the sky.

The mad acrobat bows blindly to the crowd, whimpering,

his marionette legs dividing at the knees. A tantruming child

sin-spinning away his merry-go-round memory.

 

The evening blinks, wakes drugged and naked in the morning,

his hunters eight thousand blue bicycles riding black out of my eye.

Missing mothers and fantasized fathers,

exchanging fits of laugher and interpretations of dreams,

spill like violet ink into stenciled minds.

 

Stricken, the mad acrobat peers disconsolately at the abandoned stage.

His lies four thousand ruby eyes depleting the sky.

Meek mothers and volatile fathers,

clipping the wings of zeal, secretly auction

stained glass yesterdays and papier-mâché muses.

 

Morning wears a face, silver and magnetic, mimes an afternoon,

her juggling clubs one thousand jack-in-the-box fears in my smile.

Broken bells fill the world—the rocking-horse homes,

Persian rugs, and flickering trick candles—with incorrect sound

and incorrect silence, herding wayward feelings into gravedug thoughts.

 

The mad acrobat asks again and again, is it me?, is it me?,

the homeless animal that emptied its eyes of pitiless resolve

to give itself a name and call its thoughts thoughts; the skittish wolves

chasing worry and neglect into indignant dogs; a red-nosed crisis full of laughs.

Tomorrow stretches and folds itself into today. Figure eight heroes dissolve into zeroes.

 

 

9.

It cannot be said—

 

to see it grow dim in a chamber of mistrust—

to feel it unpardonable, torn from the page

of an unutterable truth.

An unspeakably private hole in my center.

 

My tongue nails itself

to the amber cross in her sunset eyes—

 

And I see that it is you,

not her, to whom I address my silence—

 

Words harpooned in the fabric of what I see,

a daisy chain of voices enclosing what I am able to feel,

a two-faced mistress nude with the mind,

turning me against myself—

 

Dividing time into time

enslaved and time ignored—

 

as when an insult to the mind

sickens our love into a defensive coil—

a black hole of mercy—

 

Speaking, I appear,

lighting an old chaos,

from which we may never escape.

Maui is across the finger of sea.  Four birds

 Abandon their trees and bob.

 I woke them up.  As I go to get my book

 I see a spiderweb marking each

 Room, and more besides.

 Mine wags and like a soap bubble is pastel.

 An empty hexagon marks where a fly was,

 At the top.  The spider is exactly in the middle.

  

 Three other spiders are in sight.  One wants

 To make his web where one’s web already is.

 Why don’t I see this more, one spider

 In another’s web?  Why is it this way, that the webless

 Seek the most precarious?

 Twenty-seven lines hold the marked web up.

                         *** 

 This island rose up to receive the bird but it

 Received the palm.  It was naked and

 Shallow and fish-shaped to mark its origin,

 Out of the sea.

 We swam in its mouth.  The coconut,

 Readied by a reflex in seawater, settles,

 Converting its own flesh into a tree.

  

 A bobbing coconut, readied by its passion, refuses

 To open.  No.  It lands and it opens

 Canopies.  It bursts and is still and frondlike is

 No spider.  The trunk achieves the sky.  Each frond

 Blackly breaks the light.

"
leafscape and lullaby,"
Once the leaves had drained of chlorophyll,

 sculpted themselves with rouge

  

 and commissioned a warm light to gild them,

 a few threw themselves down

  

 to wash once more in this pooling

 of a water most unlike rain. And you

  

 cast yourself flat along the bodies

 of the leaves, made yourself expansive

  

 and did a wormy sort of work. Laying weight

 on the film tension of water over concrete 

  

 and gathering the leafscape to its boundaries.

 Where else might you bathe except numb

  

 in a place of your own making? The day, it went

 in serial: finding a torpor so passive

  

 as to ricochet: passion rises and falls on cue: crash

 and recovery pass in quickstep: then and done.

  

 So you’re in a new place, an unscripted space, here

 neither around nor along plotline, you’re loose

  

 and you’ve lost it. Far away someone

 is patting you, this hand lets its weight

  

 guide you gentle: far away 

 there is a place where dreams grow

  

 where they go round and quiet

 and come down from the trees you’d left 

  

 them in to find you and let you stroke

 their new teeth. You will maybe never go there.

 It is not a place where eyes go.

And then just like that, with hardly anyone  
noticing, it became daily harder to remember when  
this sense of being at sea had begun – at sea, as in  
on a wave of doubt mixed with fear and yet no small  
amount, incongruously, of fevered anticipation, not joy  
itself but the belief, still – the half-belief – some joy  
might come. Maybe  
                                  the beginning doesn’t matter anyway –

he’s trying not to look. Look at me, thinks the captain. And  
the young man’s head starts to turn toward him. Any  
moment he’ll see the captain for the first time. The way  
all histories begin, apparently. What destroys finding  
what will be destroyed, though which is which has yet to be

tearing off leaves that feel like human ears.  

We put flowers in our mouths,  

the two of us whose bodies have no thickness.  

We undress in the pink room,  

where the blinds are still closed.  

Summer is disintegrating, the heat unravels  

in the wind. I feel the skeleton inside my chest.  

Outside, emaciated dogs bark in German.  

The flowers fade like paintings.  

Parasites chew the still water  

we held our breath under.  

Breeze tears through the fibers  

of our bathing suits drying on the back of a chair.

"
aria i ii,"
**Aria (I)**

**  
**

If I were to drown myself in reckless beauty and make my wings creased lips parting,

  

 I would hover in sibilance behind you,

 my brother making a list of all instruments:

  

 our faces are mechanical copies, yours only younger

  

 and you make a grid with a pencil while I whistle

 a jazz song from the 30s (I never knew the words)

  

 and the light here is like the movies,

 defining you with shadows

  

 and staining you deep irreparable colors:

 the way you’ve let yourself look is a pleasure

  

 from which you can never return.

 Your mind is perhaps like the movie projector,

  

 always behind my head, always humming discretely,

 and a pyramid of light arrives from that uncharted point

  

 and tames the curling smoke with its certainty:

 or perhaps your mind is not like that at all.

  

 Doubtless it is a world of mechanisms nesting inside one another,

 and a sentence standing for love is hurtling somewhere unknown,

  

 but you go on cataloging the trusses and circuits,

 and I go on whistling.

  

 As you describe your count as the span of a cracked idea

 you begin to shade yourself into darkness,

  

 and I have already forgotten how I began,

 that I promised you a ravaged image to ease your burdens:

  

 and this chore blooms as the notes of a distant death passing,

 a choir’s light stretching out to the vanishing point to break.

  

  

 **Aria (II)**

  

 If I were to forget that god is not a pulley once more,

 (and where weariness has thrown me I cannot say)

  

 then you could be buried in the frost.

 I cannot bear for us to remain in heaven and on earth.

  

 Because I have stopped severing my body from the mirror

 to rise like a cloud of heat that distorts

  

 only enough to reveal its presence,

 I am standing halfway up the ladder, helpless.

  

 If you have a contract with me,

 forget it: I have perforated myself,

  

 exhausted as the nights I used to cut through

 strolling through the city where everything is designed for children.

  

 But if you must pursue me,

 I sleep in the woods outside town, waiting for summer to empty to autumn

  

 and the community pool to empty out its bodies

 and return to the self-love of its own stillness.

  

 Gravity severs us from the forgotten

 and until we knot our arteries, making one map,

  

 we will have to be patient.

 While we are in flux we cannot be located.

  

 Climbing the panels of corrugated glass,

 nothing is made for your safety

 but I am keeping watch,

  

 and for beauty I cannot drop like granite wrapped in sackcloth,

 tied to the corpse that whispered to me the secret of freedom

  

 like the Count of Monte Cristo, whose resolution meant nothing,

 into the odorless green of the Mediterranean.

"
pious,"
 

 In dreams, Mary comes draped beneath a veil, Dead

 Sea breaking at her feet, arms outstretched in that maternal

 welcoming. She wades waist-deep, covers her scars, not

 wanting to scare the children. Every mother’s duty:

 Keep the unholy origins hidden, those hauntings quiet.

 Like her, I cloak my immaculates in robes, send them off

 to learn. Soon they'll wonder, though, about the white

 detritus on my tongue when they come home, as I nod off

 mid-endearment, weighing hope against their smiles, our

 heavy goodnights before the tiny Mary in my well shakes

 her bottle full of pills, beckoning:

 Take, eat,

 in remembrance—

how the water,"
HOW  
Water heals the passage of whatever breaks  
through it. And quickly. It heals the passage  
and the break immediately. Corrects flesh  
or vegetable. Heals indiscriminately.   
The fish’s memory corrects each second   
  
cleanly. Erases it. That means   
‘abides by the water.’ So the school  
is the space between fish surrounding it.   
So the mind clears. So it polishes  
a single principle. So salmon   
  
and trout run, so the schooled fish  
synchronize. That way their passage  
continues the water. Or furthers it.   
Schools of wrasses that consume hosts’  
parasites. Called, ‘cleaning them.’ Healing  
  
the fish by reduction. Or, further, wrass  
mimics that erase the distinction. Consume  
host and parasite. And indiscriminately.   
The water heals the fish it bears  
indiscriminately. It corrects them so it clears.   
  
HOW  
No, no, there are no others. The lid wrinkles   
and breaks. The light shuffles down towards, no, we   
are the crystal veins and bones and have  
no vision. The sea vegetables loll their limp strands  
uselessly. A line draws no border. The small   
muscles school here, curl and flexing.   
As those behind a face, but the face blank   
always. So synapses glow to shed light   
cautiously. So we taper. So we tend towards  
the water dumbly. The water smoothes and tapers  
away from expression. So the current here seeks no exit.

I love you, which is a metaphor for the clear fuel   
your eyes have.  The screen has to be moral   
to be transparent, your neck being behind you,  
like a person.  It opens as if I am   
always about to intend an act, that it does  
is grace; I could go into the field with both of my hands   
and the field slightly on them,  
like the scent of metal  
or seeing a face with no tense.   
  
I would be coincident   
with a hologram,   
the accident of it being like a color  
as if hands are colored.  I promise to surveil you   
because the image is what is beautiful.

music finds me twenty miles down silence,"
Music finds me twenty miles down silence

 Where I burrow almost

 Cruelly, there it enters

 The recesses I have cut, it says see this is just

 Like anywhere

 I can fill it

  

 I say thanks music you are

 The final touch

 As you also were the first

 But please not too much you draw me

 Out of myself and all I am

 Is you cheerful

  

 In your soil under my blade

 Leaking into the vessels

 You fill before they were ever

 Empty, you my body,

 I am greater I wrestle you

 Under the border

  

 Below which is not your kingdom

 Though you were born there:

 The way you fall there

 Is like remembering

 I like this and keep digging

  

 You do not mind

 And moonlit nights you raise

 Your watersnake head out of the lower kingdom

 Into yours, there you resemble me

 Double and quiet, sharp for there is

 Not much of you, making an eye

  

 Out of what you aren’t,

 Night’s inner face how

 Could it not examine you,

 Whitehead like bride’s hair

 In waves the color of waiting

 You wait expecting home

  

 And are gone

  

 And it is grander,

 Sky calling *stranger*,

 Waves you made uneasy

 In their stomachs, moon 

 That almost answered,

 Even I have to thank you: for your spilling

  

 As if into my eye’ s unlit

 Socket expanded it

 And in your passing I am cold

 And larger, and the sky

 Never held such memory,

 So empty a moment, such

 

Future to fill

                               to dangle in the air, the near-shorn coat of an overgrown sheep swung just below the belly, 

                               attached by a few strong deluded fibers, or caught in the tropopause, perhaps on a

                               turtled with the government-issued tools to blow out the circuits. I crunch numbers and recede 

                               into the final blue, preparing for each man to reach his Pinnacle, preparing to be awash with 

                               the same diffusive surprise that pierces the sky: a languorous explosion of color, the cheeks 

                               warm with guilt, caught, yellow laughter fat in the mouth, sluicing into the beard

                               planted in its devout rubber mass of skin, but even in the end, rapturous decorum must be 

                               maintained: my uniform, its badges winking to no one, will stay buttoned to my neck, soon 

                               to be melded into my skin, long after the last man tessellates into place and dissolves. May

                               so sure of the command, which trembles with breath—corporeal, sinewy, almost prayer

"
speech acts,"

The philosophers say there are words  
      that do things, make themselves  
      real in the world,  
so that when you said  
      *I promise,*  
      you had to have meant it  
and when together you said *I do*  
      the bond was real in every sense.  

Those are the examples, but there are others  
      like when I said *I’m queer*  
      it did something – not to you  
      (tho I guess a little bit to you)  
      but to my world and my body  
and when you first taught me the word  
           *woman*  
           *man*  
      that did something too.  

I think these words are the closest real thing  
      to prayer. To toss a stone across  
      the frozen pond and see if it smash  
      open or skip with grace and stop.  

But my voice will not hold my body.  
And I don’t know if I can speak *transition*  
      or swallow it.  

Tell me, can I say  
      *I am?*

If I had faults to speak of they would be  
That I’m bad at pretending to be working.  
Summer is meant to make you sweat and if  
Your skin isn’t sloppy enough you best pack  
Up, leave earth by latest May. I don’t think  
You would need to sweat in space because  
There’s no one there to tell you to. Here there  
Are pools on earth, mostly lakes, and some  
What oceans. Slacking off at work, I found  
Myself watching footage of the moon landing,  
With arrows showing wires pulling men across  
The so-called “moon.” Accidentally, my sound  
Was on. There are parts of the ocean so deep  
They make a noise like high, the highest thing—  
And my boss once told me her dad believed  
He picked up, from his radio, the distress calls  
Amelia Earhart sent before she died. So I’m wide  
With apology when she hears about the moon  
Landing, across the room, having happened  
""Here on earth."" I didn't want you to find out  
Like this, I tell her. Now there’s nowhere to go.

young sick bacchus,"

near. Stay here

with me, stung  
smell of lye,  
latherless my arms  
wasting hot, 

 sandalwood fixed  
to lathe and whirring.  
Rowel me on—come, look  
what I’ve done for you, 

 I’ve counted  
these twenty-some grapes  
clinging to sallow stem  
thin as a wick—

 dressed in my finest  
white linen, helix  
of ivy tricked  
into my hair, 

 ibex beauty,  
suspense of black  
grapes hanging off  
this wooden table 

 like an upturned hand—  
pour another, it’s stronger  
than it looks, and table’s ajar,  
nothing will stay put 

today, peaches careening away  
and outside a radio tuning,  
crackling of flies outside  
the window of this rented room, 

 even my tunic’s  
slipping loose, don’t  
look—do you know  
about the great man’s ruby— 

 heavy gleam like  
 sewer water sputtering  
through Rome’s stone gutters  
pinned to his finger, 

 and if you kiss it  
 you catch it, slippery  
as scum. These grapes  
are a long thread 

 of black rubies,  
only indulgence  
I could spare  
today, 

 don’t take them all.  
But just one more?  
As boys we dangled  
the bunches down 

 into each other’s mouths—  
open up—  
sudden breaking  
on tongues muffled 

 grapeskin sticking  
 at the back of the throat  
like a word unvoiced—  
as late one afternoon

 he and I scampered off  
 to the olive grove,  
 fruitless, grey, something like  
abstract statuaries, 

 sun high overhead  
but shadows lengthening  
toward us as we entered  
the stucco-walled field, 

 dusty scent of quartz  
 on the air, and what started  
falling was snow,  
 white as a placebo— 

 how much control  
 do you think I have—  
and his hand inside  
my tunic a warm body, 

 and all that time aware  
of where the yew grows,  
sticks if you stumble,  
let’s not go there— 

 and the bushes  
of prickly rosemary  
are beautiful because  
they move like the soul, 

 piling sharp on sharp  
in weak banks  
too tight to wave in wind,  
and even I will agree, 

 when it snaps  
the smell stays  
in the mind a long time  
like a fugue recorded,

sound of the piano  
bench creaking  
under the man  
with the fingers.

 I’m getting so thin,  
that bench wouldn’t know  
I’m there, or that piano,  
or this table— 

 a bench for you  
 if you’d care to stay,  
toy my ring of ruby  
with your lips, 

 graceful just once more.  
I hope it’s not—  
oh, boys. The wine’s  
a bit young 

 but it will do the trick,  
and do you like  
what you can see,  
all these goodies, 

 they’re only here  
because you are here—  
open up, open up.

The Dancing Plague of 1518,"

I am headless in morning, so ask me to dance.  

And it’s simple, I never relapse. I admit  
it was me who once broke all the stars. Yes, I wrote  
the last word. But I really don’t understand why  

Shania Twain had no last shred of self once I was done  

with her. All man I feel I have no bones. Like worms  
in labs, heads having been removed, who dare still move  
as lacking nothing. What we lack is little more  

than it all. As in Strasbourg, how hundreds did dance  

without rest. And the boiling still deep in the streets:  
find once-ice. Long past vendors of nicotine, bread,  
through the throng. And four-hundred more join. Do not look  

at how all bodies fall to earth and meet the God who moves  

them. Better become child again. Let limbs be shaken off.  
themselves and grab the un-denying. Shania  
(the Queen) knew just what she was doing over me.

One of the horses was dead and it made for a \
start to the day. Warm for the month for the year \
so far. The kind that comes with sun and rain and \
rain with lightning. That kills horses. Apparently. \
I didn’t see the horse. I saw your face cave and \
saw it come back. There’s no good antonym for \
caving. Some things take work and time. You \
narrow your eyes when you look far ahead. Your \
pupils contract in the sunlight. Then you smile. \
The future is mostly a whole lot of physiological \
change. And expectation. And then some. When \
I think about death my stomach hurts. When I \
think about horses I am usually wrong. I thought \
horses stood while they slept, but they can sleep \
lying down. Bodies at rest become bodies at \
work. Even decay can be no easy feat. Requires \
work and time. Are we like or unlike horses. We \
are not like this horse. This horse is different. \
This horse is dead. But the field looks greener \
than it looked before. The water pools where our \
feet have moved the earth. It pools on the road. It \
doubles us. I want to know if there is ever \
enough symmetry. At Trader Joes the answer to \
symmetry is lots. Pastels, gold lettering. I want to \
buy an orchid. $12.99 in a ceramic, purple vase. \
It feels like they’re reading my mind. When my \
card is declined the staff is kind. They say it \
happens to all of us but it’s happening to me. I \
feel like I’m watching myself watch the horse. \
But the grass is very green.

weeknight news reports,"
We’ve climbed up on the roof before,

 barefoot and shivering, at one time

 there were no empty rooms, so many people in

 the house, sounds of living and maybe

 even singing. A voice that wasn’t ours.

 We heard it then, under all those blazing stars

  

 I mean pixels. Screen glows from within,

 pulses in a waterfall, some kind of heartbeat

 when we finally get up to close the door

 when we do our homework after all these hours.

 My mother calls, I want to be right where you are,

 sleep, I love you, TV ruins your eyes.

  

 It’s 11 pm and death is on my mind,

 accidents upon accidents, blood and gore

 somewhere in the streets, she

 is the time passing and sick, invading dark

 people gone missing—could she have been?

 No, says my sister, but she’s young and has no power

  

 over things we can’t trust and things we can’t see.

 I’m young and have no power, am small, never win

 but I check the empty driveway, look up at the sky line

 inside, it’s my sister; outside, the lights and cars,

 and all I want are her footsteps upstairs, the shower

 running in the bathroom, her work clothes on the floor.

  

 I daydream of flashes and have visions of scars

 studding the roads, the bodies, my mother and flowers

 I left her, Fiji in the back seat and rosary beads

 I prophesy the petals tearing, stems breaking into the night

 as glass shatters the world and blends into her skin,

 she doesn’t pick up and I’m still watching the war

  

 footage from Iraq. Fallujah’s dust rises into towers

 and creates people out of nothing, I blink and start

 to think my eyes are deceiving me. Behind, my sister snores

 and listening I think that the roof would be cold by now, heat

 extinguished in the stars above the lamplights hanging, pinned.

 This is the part where we find out she dies.

"
oblation,"
It’s hot in the middle of the storm. It’s humid  
gray. Makes the dust bloat. I can hardly breathe in  
it, air moving too fast for me to hold onto, wind’s body  
swimming over mine. Like being in a room when all  
anyone wants is a little power over you, arms stroking  
against heads, black wide glass eyes darting, staying afloat...

 In dance class we are told to fall forward–  
hurtling our bodies ahead, asking to be caught  
by our selves once we get there. What I put forward as  
flesh gets pushed back by wind. Our bodies hurtle against  
each other, one risen from the sea, one made out  
of clay... Power is a series of erasures. You fall into it. You  
push against it. It pushes back. The wind is full of coyotes  
saying, saying –

 Some days, I say, I don’t think of it  
at all. I wake up having already been loved  
by the entrance of the day, the day that says come out  
now. The day that says the earth is your friend and you  
have a secret between you– it is your life. You walk out  
under the blue carpet of night and see planes migrating

 overhead, then a fountain, this magnolia tree, its pink  
fisted buds newly unclenched, dormancy beat open,  
pushing up against the seed-coat... Here we are,  
we did not ask to be woken, though it was not easy,  
not safe, we open as oblations on a dark branch,  
pink-veined luscious mouths drummed open by rain.  
A voice inked with water and wind rises. And the black  
loam beneath.

REPRINTED FROM 1908 ISSUE

  

 Around her fountain which flows

 With the voice of men in pain,

 Are flowers that no man knows. 

 Their petals are fanged and red

 With hideous streak and stain;

 They sprang from the limbs of the dead.—

 We shall not come here again. 

  

 Panthers rise from their lairs

 In the forest which thickens below,

 Along the garden stairs

 The sluggish python lies;

 The peacocks walk, stately and slow,

 And they look at us with the eyes

 Of men whom we knew long ago.

petulant weeds,"
Look at the sad people barely putting up

 with the flight patterns of pollen.

 Look at them troubled by one more

 irritation in their lives.

 They will be the last ones standing

 when the great forests are felled

 and the imperious sunflowers are finally uprooted

 and the petulant grasses are tamed to law-abiding highways.

 Some poet will rise up to speak on behalf

 of the Bornean orangutan and the Ili pika

 and some Hollywood director will find the great composer

 of metaphors and the camera will worship

 her fingernails and eyelashes before he lets her fade

 behind the closing credits. He will whimper

 in the darkness, and like us, stumble towards

 the nearest pharmacy and run his hands

 pensively over the boxed nasal sprays

 knowing how difficult to read real estate reports

 when your eyes are stone and gravel and how

 difficult, too, listening to impenitent developers,

 styling their bejeweled class rings and tie-clips,

 whisper *property, property, property*.

 Under the dirt,

 she calls the salt

 it’s time

 it happens the more

 I want it to. I didn’t

 realize how dry

 make, how it is time

 to break the rock in two,

 to pull up the roots,

 acorns have stormed

I know nothing

the dirt I

thought was rock.

I didn’t realize how

how much

salt pervades,

how I may

have forgot

how much

was one.

on seeing my first western,"
**1 / Meeting Burt**  
  
Burt Lancaster and I don’t   
have much to die for: love   
of the game and the gold  
and the girl not as much    
  
makes simple to say she’s not   
beautiful, perpetually   
never quite undressed,   
dusty and sweaty under  
that scarf, her dress, her   
face, wide plain, blessed   
expanse glistening daily   
above breasts long fought  
  
for, Burt and I, too old  
now to care about love.  
  
  
**2 / Losing Burt**  
  
The tropes gather faster when Burt appears,   
he’s lost craps and a woman, broke and rebuffed,    
smirking and grumbling that humans make love   
face to face, a remark worthy of some score-  
settling cowboy in spurs, not you, Burt, your  
single regard for time and rock blown rough  
in one moment’s furnace of sticks, sweaty, buffed,  
refusing objection your fusework near blears   
human loss so unsavory  
                                               I’m lost, Burt,  
can’t tell your face features through the sure  
group’s tactics and horses, making calm  
ill-advised, more fitting to flail and blurt  
guilt in tumid air that soaks these shores  
without oceans,  
                               Your hand is creased without a palm.  
  
  
**3 / Replacing Burt (On Seeing a Different Western)**  
  
Burt and I have had a falling out   
I say loud, hoping after a reaction,  
eyeing with verve and meaning my now   
and new loved outlaw, lanky Gary. Faction  
  
different this time, clean-shaven and freshly   
married, on the run not from the long   
law but the lawless. Blonde-sweet Miss Kelly  
headstrong and stupid—seems he’s on the wrong   
   
side of her Quaker complaints. He stays to greet  
a death mimed by cruel schoolboys. A crime  
for their sake. Boys scatter. Streets empty. Smutty heat,   
smutty Gary beneath the Marshall sign,  
  
moral and certain, leather and tallow.

"
waiting at stonewall,"

It’s a Friday in New York  
and fifty years from ’69.  
Though since we’ve yet to meet  
or have, and are still looking,  
what we’ve said to each other  
in photos and films, bars  
and basements, returns  
with enough echo  
to remind us of ourselves.  
Those of us who resisted heroes  
and sentiment. Those of us  
who waited and found neither—  
not the promised liberation  
in marriage, or the salvation  
of laws. How some asked  
to carry America’s guns  
and did. How others knew  
equality was a rumor,  
elusive as freedom or sex.  
Do you think about dying  
every time you have sex?  
I still think about dying.  
I do think about death.  
Or a day in childhood when I saw  
the only place I could live  
was here. Inside.  
So whoever wanted me  
had to come through the body.  
Which has rarely been beautiful  
to me. Too soft and unconvincing.  
Too small. I hope the future  
is free of god and memory.  
I hope the future is  
all body, all blood.  
And since to be queer  
is a way to forgive life,  
I’ll take as long as I want  
finishing my cigarette on Seventh,  
walking up Christopher  
and thinking of everyone  
who’s yet to get here—  
somewhere in a bedroom maybe,  
young and bored across  
the country, not impressed  
by our parades or idols,  
all the sponsorship we bought.  
I’m late for a drink but wander,  
handsome and aimless,  
looking for a sign  
before nodding to the dead  
who always need a light.  

"
whose woods these are we think,"
When they ask “What are you working on now that the elements

 are finished” i say the elements are never finished; in China they

 have metal, in India they have ether, in the West we are short on

 time. Wood has also been named as an element. In Euro fairy

 tales, children are sent into the woods, probably the Black Forest,

 carrying baskets covered with cloth made by child laborers just as

 factories are beginning. When i first read the Frost snowy woods 

 piece as a desert child in the 60s, i experienced a calm as he enters 

 the whose woods these are he thinks he knows, though i didn’t 

 know that many woods in Tucson or a little horse thinking it queer 

 or a village. What would it have been like to be sent out with a 

 small covered basket if you were a peasant child into what we now 

 call the ecotone, the region between two environments— a marsh 

 with striped frogs for example— then on into the woods where a 

 peasant uprising is being planned. 

                      We have sent them all into the woods 

                      We have sent them all into the woods 

                      We have sent them all into the woods 

 & we know exactly whose thin logged-out woods these are. What

 do people need from poetry during the changes? The changes are 

 immeasurable. Perception, form, & material locked into the 

 invisible. Many need calm poetry, especially at weddings where 

 they feel uneasy, & i would certainly write that way if i believed 

 calm were key to any of it, but if what woods are left are lovely, 

 dark, deep, they are also oblique, obscure, magical, owned for 

 profit, full of fragile unnamed species, scarce on time, time that 

 barely exists though people base their lives on imagining it does. i 

 hoped to find some wisdom to send back to you & that is what i 

 am working on now, my present hopeful wild & unknown 

 friends…

        (*not sure what nonhuman meaning means*)

 So, here we are now.         Unknowing beauty among

hand-in-hand, my fingers stuck beneath your skirt.  
I looked to the hills from whence cometh my help.  
I lived in the history of the future where  
some of us would not die. When asked to keep on  
the straight and narrow, when presented  
with the lineup of Tom, Dick, and Harry,  
I ducked to enter a pink hole.

 They can’t dig that deep.

 Eighteen meters of wire fencing,

 four sides of four and a half,

 I worked for room and board.

 In July, at dinner,

 empty, its narrow wooden slats

 in the corn husks below the porch,

 drinking one glass of sambuca Ramazzotti

 He stared into its milky white

 snow globe murk before each sip.

 He told me he once trapped rabbits

 and snapped their necks

 but that he didn’t use live traps

 anymore. I found one in the bushes,

 an ancient and empty cage,

 and he slipped his fingers

 into his trap’s square lattice,

 two centimeters by two centimeters,

 white knuckles clinging

 to rusted memory.

 there must have been others,

 entangled and forgotten in blueberry folds –

 proceed without caution ungrateful out of staters.

 I have come here to take credit for every bid

 I have come here to take credit if you would

 I have come here to take what is due to one

 pressed to make fuel like grapes to wine.

 I have come here to be Dionysus with vine in

 I have come here to show you the bottom of

 the mine which mules do not leave until shot

 which my family left three generations ago.

 I have come riding on a mule today with my

 great grandfather walking it as an American

 nativity pageant heading for Philadelphia.

 I have his life insurance evaluation his calipers

 from Frackville Service Equipment Corporation

 his Pottsville Explosive comb case to show you.

 I will show you no more, for you need to look for

The patrolman approaches slow, scared      I will jump.  

                                    He is so young.  

                                    His hands tremble      like the word please.  

               But I have no intention today of leaving my body.  

I’ve paused &nsbp;    only to watch the surfers collide with the Pacific.  

               Such strange symmetry:       what the wave gives,        what it takes.  

                      Where one bails beneath the break,        another glides to shore.  

                             See, I want to say.  
                             We live.  

                             &—  

Every poem contains the dead.  

Creatures worrying the bones.

I have a habit of avoiding funerals.        Instead, I pretend,      I rewind,       I keep—  

        look, how I still play scrabble with Nanu,     her nose too close to the board.  

               She never loses her sight,       her words,  

               never collapses into coma,         then further.  

        Listen, how Brian still calls just ‘cuz—       giddy spring kiss, another man’s lips.  

                      I never pried about the girls.

                                           hanging—  

                             —&  

How often we try to kill things in ourselves.  

                                           Regret, the unsaid,         our mothers.  

        But the body is an archive  

                             even as it burns.  

My mother’s spine is leaking  

                      & I am somewhere else,  

                      watching the sea exhale,      watching fog swallow pier, coastline, city.  

                      Everything—awash.

        Who would we be if we held all of it—grief, history, each other—  

                                                  soft      as the fawn’s unflinching gaze?

I admire the forest floor:       log decaying, root reaching for root,        No partition.

march,"
How many steps does it take

 to reach the low green narrow-

  

 leaves which in a dream

 were slowly being devoured

  

 by cows and just a few sheep.

 The animals are not hungry

  

 grazing beside the wicker-

 chair porch, you reading and eating 

  

 a nectarine almost ripe.

 If we could use any of it

  

 our skulls would perforate,

  

 would feel filamental

 light braid itself through.

  

 The pasture is a lawn.

  

 Closely mowed it is

 a household linen,

 cushioned by sod,

  

 made toxic by rain, peppered

 by the wings of many insects.

engine on,"
I had a blow-up raft I used to ride. Down to the summer sea. Dolphins swam beside. Twice saved someone from drowning.

  

 Not me, but my bottle-nosed friends, by whom I was gently buffeted.  Dozed. The undertow could have its way with me. It never did. 

  

  

  

 Someone pushed the throttle down on the great white yacht. The ocean seemed to flush like a toilet around me.

  

 One great scoop of sand went down my pants each time. Scratched my butt like the surface of a home movie. Deep.

  

  

  

 The raft has gone the way of the waterbed. The one hit wonder The Floaters sang “Float On.” Then floated on.

  

 But me, I hit the waves on vinyl. “From Here to Eternity.” I should be harder now. The kind of plastic that doesn’t fade in the sun.

shadow of a cactus and an orchid on the wall next to jacqueline,"
  from above he focuses the lens on the spots under

 the rim of her brow. Kisses to the skin. Those you cannot take. She tells him

 that which makes up this world is the beautification of our mistakes. The

 error, the error preceded by the other, an error, and Jacqueline

  

 is so beautiful, even the painter, even the young man turned old, will marry her,

 and draw her, and remember her shape, every day, as though he were missing from it…

 So that when the sun sets the orchids mellow.

 Who is left to make a picture of these creatures.

  

 When the clouds quiet down over the rooms in the house.

 These floors, to walk them, is beautiful,

 though they were made for Jacqueline.  He leaves the lights on,

 the plants dried, sometimes even the paint

 hardens overnight. The cheekbones of

  

 a woman will lift the more her mother misses her…

 In one year he paints her one hundred

 and sixty times. To count the days that belong

 still to the sky.

 How beautiful she was.

 She tells him.

 When even the film dries out

 he paints her neck as long as he can make it. He leaves her

  

 all his sculptures. Were she here, he would not find her. Were she 

 a desert bird and not a Parisian queen she would have imprinted on

 this wall long ago, and wakened the shadows that run amok it, and tried,

 blooming flower from blooming flower, to summon

 the small air that makes the ground lift one step closer to its firmament.

 point, the key

  

 II. 

 The twice-painted women 

 are strung silent.

  

 The boy sits in air’s 

 clear fire between

  

 wrought music stand, 

 wrought railing. The scene

  

 orients around 

 the unseen bodiless

  

 dancer the women 

 are bodies of.

 The wrought railing 

 strains for the world 

 of green the world 

 of time – in this house

  

 sheer cliffs, the window’s 

 slice of green a slice 

 of time, a sharp absent 

 point on the burnt piano-top 

 where the metronome mocks 

 the candle, taps

 its own candlelife out

 as the candle lost 

 in its shining locks 

 is too much song, 

 is not hope

What is language is a new needed

 For the going on part of the end 

 You can tell has made it here because

  

 The air is with condition

 The outside seems to be like anything

 Placed in a lab or subway car

  

 The truths are showing through

 The people have chosen to be

 Each moves along fresh tracks

  

 On the erasable surface

 Toward a tiny destiny

 Wearing vraiment raiment

  

 It’s maybe three days after

 Or exactly during seeing

 The future put on its certainties

  

 I want of the opposite to speak

 To say what isn’t etymology, won’t

 Be money to the king above my eye

  

 Reach out to the invisible third

 Among every two pedestrians

 Where belonging bucks its norms

  

 Difference lives in the least places

 Shine caught in the multiple

 Lie of any kind of hair

  

 You can’t tell if it’s order or not

 To follow the too many paths

 Just above the face, below sky

  

 Long enough to forget or be

 Distracted from the big geographies

 Where truth first learned of us

  

 In the pit of an education

 In the skysick life of power

 In its moving rearrangements

  

 I was walking on Mission Street

 In love with you while damage bloomed

 The right order right in the words

  

 Below the preserved fade of marquees

 The little sale of needless things

 Listing bodies listed just past

  

 It was far too easy to get here

 Standing still while white time flowed

 Around its professional mourners

  

 Comfortable in end after end

 The next one isn’t very pretty

 At least we’ll see how together

  

 It provides absent alternatives

 My plan to put my body between

 Where it already was and is going

seem tame,"
Falls blue. Time, it is that small  
silver weight in my hand, cool  
as a pebble damp grass smoothes— 

now quiet the rustling, crossing  
of legs, coy bangles clattering  
like little bells of tin, long minute

spent smoothing my wrinkled brocade  
as the strum starts under the song—  
I’ve gone up this path five times

and gone down four, hear me out—  
when you rise in the last morning,  
in the shrinking hour thick

with smoke of yeast and sugar,  
think of me. Not my face—  
overcast with leafed lanterns swaying, 

forest above town greener  
as just before rain and just after,  
until out of each paper sphere a bird

breaks, flocks, and all life looks up,  
taut like drum-skin  
a handful of earth clatters onto, 

specks into eyes turning down  
sloping back into the city—  
that crust I can hook out

in the mornings, first thing,  
small seeds hard as seconds  
between my fingers . . . 

And what has been within me  
is true, just as I wanted.  
Wanted a field of dissent settling

as roan ridden into slow grass,  
mottle-coat of lustring  
and the throat-cut string still vibrating—

wanted unsteady. Wanted fall,  
but it was winter before we reached  
the middle. Wanted the pearly hum of

beginning set into a silver bezel,  
wanted to be thought mastered, thought  
wanted, pendular, yours. For a moment.

Wicked wienie wonce was woman whuut. That’s what you wrote in my yearbook. We were in bra and panties it was fright night alright.

  

 Now don’t get your panties in a bunch, you’d say. I pictured carrots. Bugs Bunny munching scanties that were worn by Elmer Fudd.

  

 But everything was a slasher flick with you. Or mutants. You wouldn’t see aliens. Devil flicks bored you. You screwed the devil you said

  

 and he wasn’t any good. That’s a devil for you. Speak of the devil, saw the ex on a cross-town bus. I’d like to say he let himself go.

  

 But no more than I. No more than Tallulah Bankhead had in Die, Die My Darling or Bette Davis in Burnt Offerings.

  

 Which, by the way, you refused to see. And who could blame you? You said you’d seen enough trash. Swinging an axe.

Until the moth takes

Hold up a flashlight

Across your screen  
the moth wings  
are many and pressings  
wrinkled hands cupping

and dropping the dark.  
Overhead a light  
aurora performs its  
handless weavings.

 These are our angels:  
the luminous who sing

against diffusive spread,"

When left alone I do what I often do. Which is lift out  
some worms from my box of worms  
and split their hair-scale bodies in half with a needle.  
Everything in the body can be made perfectly clear  
by soaking it in sugar. This means the light stops changing.  
When I break the right kind of worm its eggs explode  
out of it and keep growing. At those times,  
as required, I sit around in the dark and watch.  

In general I try to have no expectations that you’ll love me  
from one moment to the next. And every night  
my body breaks the spirit of the law. I think  
it is vitally important to say nothing. I hope to never  
accidentally ask not to be alone. You are the most  
sophisticated type of person, whose cells don’t die,  
whose inputs and outputs are smoothly coordinated  
and all sound exactly right.  

An egg or other cell, when watched,  
listens all around it for its friends, and if it does  
or does not hear them, then it pinches  
itself in half or just shy of half, and splits.  
I look with a laser in each egg for the glowing dot  
that marks a future head, which is also how,  
I think, we learn which of our sides is inside. In this way  
everything in the body can be made perfectly clear.

the silver hyphens,"
To my amazement, someone is dancing.  
Eternal Biedermeier, the sound of windshield wipers  
Lulling the car, making of the rain  
A beloved shape-shift deeply, my sister’s  
Charm bracelet on the wheel rhyming “Ramapo”

   
With “Brahms’ Alto”, the sound is stronger than hills  
Yielding to facts. This is my poem,  
A paean to dementia. This embraces  
Dementia. The rain conceals a little,  
Then is wiped away. The next exit

   
Toys with the undercarriage gently.  
Rain makes a gorgeous pattern on the glass.  
Let us begin: we are driving in the rain.  
Rampant, redoubled, sister and I see  
The rain so beautiful and then an empty

   
Windshield equally deathless, dazzling  
Winter bees with a mountain on each wing.  
By noon, nothing remains but romantic litter.  
Biedermeier at all the outposts beats,  
Whirrs, thuds. One charm upon her bracelet

   
Rings my eye with emerald around.  
The first word of the risen Christ was “Woman”.  
Did Magdalene require a further word?  
Is there a forgotten country, *un pays vague,*  
Behind the vexed and uxorious country

   
Forgotten just now? Litter of rain,  
Little winter birds suggest as much. The aftermath  
Of Bellerophon was olive groves. But see:  
The shadows of olive trees turn instantly  
To water. Waves of light, in a concourse

   
Of silver hyphens, drench new patterns of herbs  
Near to home. Home is a southern studio.  
Mother dotes upon the downing moon.  
My sister drives a Biedermeier toy.  
To my amazement, someone is dancing.

Myself am green in this:

 the moon let some light

 intensely on the grass.

 The knots on the trunk would make a face on it,

 if one were further in.

 When clouds, the moon’s amok,

 becomes less relevant,

 and cannot hold much.

 What I think of is how,

 when the light is switched off,

 the last thing seen (a lamp)

 flashes on your eyelids.

 What I want is a chair to sit,

 of which I am very certain.

the meetings with the man on the toilet will end thursday,"
It is the right of the student to leave his shoes 

 outside the bathroom for the man himself squats barefoot.  

 In the mornings the man finishes another book, orders his milk,

 and when the milkman comes to fetch his tip,

  

 it is the right of the student

 who has forgotten the money again to ask for forgiveness. 

 It is forgiveness that trembles in the open

 window and the open window that 

  

 cries out to the world outside the bathroom

 of the twenty-fourth floor

 where the mirror is turned 

 upside down on the floor

  

 to support Picasso’s “Prophet holding a baby owl.”

 In the bathroom,

 it is Picasso who proffers the soap bar. In the bathroom, 

 the student and the man talk little, drink milk,

  

 listen to the marionettes for it is winter, 

 and finally come to the conclusion that there will never be

 anything of substance to argue about, and so

 the meetings with the man on the toilet will end. It is Thursday. 

  

 It is the right of the student to leave the bathroom at this point. 

 At this point the man will stand up 

 from his seat, flush, wash, sigh.

 The milkman will himself choose to take a rain check,

  

 The student will, as is his right, mention to his mother

 the name of the man with whom he has spent

 his mornings, and his mother will lament to the church. 

 The mirror will be newly hung 

  

 on the wall opposite the window,

 and as the snow nestles into the cracks of the 

 lonely apartment, a voice will 

 be heard on the telephone, sullen but crisp,

 answering the questions it has posed to itself.

in ravenna with my sister,"
*For LR*

  

 At first

 I saw just one light

 crisp blue

  

 line, nearly

 skylike, there, high above

 the rest

  

 of the stone,

 unkept, a bright slice

 of the

  

 fine mosaic

 sets, unstressed. I reached out:

 *Hey, look*

 * *

 *up, excuse me*

 *there, look up.*

  

 She looked

 like an exceptional criminal,

 or a cranial

  

 angel, or

 like something of a lazy

 hunter with

  

 eyes unmet.

 Faintly, she ground her

 shoulders

  

 down one

 by one, falling taut: *Look*

 *up, please,*

 * *

 *this is a very rare*

 *picture of the earth.*

  

 Then, I saw so

 many more, as if the blue slice

 said, ‘at once

  

 go’ or, ‘time

 for vespers,’ and all of the shy

 lines, the shier

  

 colors, burst

 forth and up, untaming, a light

 and limited

  

 take off not

 to space of course but to the very top

 and back:* Look*

 * *

 *up, my sister,*

 *look up, my sister.*

  

 Suddenly I saw

 that all of the lines were gone, even the sky-

 like first lit

  

 slice, gone, swift

 as a storm’s turn, and in the dark

 she looked

  

 just like the

 poet, but so much stonier than

 stone, a wax-

  

 ing statue for

 all beautiful men and stone, so I looked

 up: *Silhouette,*

 * *

 *linger me dimly,*

 *then extinguish.*

 My tusks had been holding you up. I am sorry for it.

 The most dangerous place in the world

 is the world, or becomes the world

 after you have to flee into it. Even the cap

 of an acorn, or the wind-distributed promise

 of a future accord, will do, since all families are

 adoptive, or they are failed families, or they are both,

 as wind chimes need the wind

 to tell what they falsely believe to be “their own story”;

 the echoes in that cavern must also do justice

 to the last chipmunks on earth. They fell in love,

 delighting the birthday party, who saw it all

 last year (age median: eight and a half). We hold

 their hypothetical findings at a distance

 until we realize we are in there too,

 in the freezing not-quite-

 forever of an artificial-

 butter-and-paste-scented theater, where everything rings

 and nothing gets picked up, and you have to hunt

 your own critters if you want critters, to get out

 and then sneak back in with some help from that freaky invention

 your sister called “fire.” And that’s why we never came home.

"
pink room,"
We are contemporaries, born in  
the worst plague year for our kind.  
It is May, locust shells in the screen doors.  
The surf is thick with ash. An unnamed man  
roams the beach, looking for a place  
deep inside himself, like a room lined in silk.  
You are a piece of shit, like me.  
Between us, three ceramic teeth  
glued to our jaws. I leave my hair curly  
for seven months. I love you because you can’t be destroyed by love;  
we are immune  
to one another: my perfect Tennyson, your fingers  
tearing the metal strings of a guitar. We stop  
wearing underwear, spring lays its dust over everything,  
flies climb our naked shoulders.  
"
winter sketch,"
Leaf carried

 left. Brittle-cold grass, where I want to insert

 first the asphalt, first the rain

 thawing on the brick. Silence unfolds

 its loud mutterings.

 Pierced by a cry. Black bird,

 yellowed beak. Not pierced,

 threaded. Bird finds the grain

 of the still air, slips a voice through

 and between the layers. First sees

 the layers. Soon the instant

 when the falling water is only

 what falls from branches, edge of

 gutter, off the leaves.

 Taps on the hard grass.

 New silence after

 this one. I plucked a smooth

 green needle from a low-hanging off-shoot,

 the branch leaning in to me as if to hear

 more clearly. Pulled bowstring.

 The needle: flexed it between two fingers,

 folding it in half. Pressed it between two teeth,

 convex side down, flattening its slight

 curvature. I would have closed my eyes

 to do it more carefully. 

"
laocoon,"
What I need is a simple algorithm  
for hearing myself.

   
I must learn to talk  
as the birds talk amongst themselves.

   
I sit beside you facing the sea.  
Hold the shell. Press it to your ear.

   
Beyond, a field: dry  
grass, the yellow suggests

   
green. Directionless action,  
thought pouring out

   
from your body. Take the shell.  
This is just sound. Just

   
memory — circled twice by cords,  
your face contorted, your crying

   
for your children, the recognition  
of another, finally,

   
after all this time, at once with  
such force, silence

   
then the abrupt departure  
of silence. Cloud-cover,

   
soaking rain. Soaking  
wet. The sea washes,

   
then eddies, spray caught  
in spray. Coming home,

   
I walk out back and

 study the far side of my house.

   
The wall deflects light, and light springs  
back from the wall in rhythm.

   
How can it be turned so much, mid-flight,  
in the last glittering moment? Nothing

   
is a circuit in the way we try to believe —  
as if the whole wheel turns at once.

   
What hunts us from the past  
rises toward us, demanding

   
the thing bargained for. We cannot both  
make it out. Sometimes, I wish it weren’t

   
me. I still remember your face. The wind taps  
on my home. The rays dissolve

   
in my eye, dissolve in a flurry of  
color, and everything is birds,

   
your pink mouth is just birds.

"
notes on with the ants in guatemala,"


I should have said that I am on the brink of emotional disaster, sitting alone at the  
end of a rustic dock unsure if whitecaps from the lake sways us, or if it is turmoil  
from within. There have been no ducks, perhaps never any at all. Every morning, a  
hummingbird dipped in white and black before the garish flowers.  

I should have said that ants are a way of looking down instead of looking up, that  
leafcutters in particular, form the largest, most complex societies after humans. I do  
not think there will be much left after us. On Earth — where traveling against the  
flow of migration leads me to indigenous cultures, revealing one privilege of the  
place where I was born.  

And when a woman from Michigan on *la lancha* shared with me her amazement at  
how the Mayans suffer poor vision but never go get glasses, that she sends money  
each month to the family of her adopted child, that she hopes the local boys fishing  
with spools can grow up to have “good lives,” it is because I am practicing restraint.  
In watching the ants, my footsteps had razed part of their trail and they frantically  
skittered around the intrusion. Guilt, I think, is dangerous to act upon without long  
consideration.  

I don’t know how to tell you where I am, a place my mind grasps at. Volcán San  
Pedro: where tourists hire armed guards to flank them on their trek to the top. Do it  
for your safety, do it for peace of mind, the forums say. “Tourista Policia [sic] armed  
with 9mm Beretta pistols,” and the beaming, damp-faced selfies, panoramas of Lake  
Atitlán from up top — shared thousands of miles back home with captions like  
“Living my best life.”  

I should have said the staring from men in trucks as I walk the rocky path between  
villages feels more menacing when we don’t share a language. What am I doing  
here?  

I should have said that back home, I lived in a house with a man and his guns. That  
a lawyer told his wife how cases of rape and domestic violence skyrocket after major  
sporting events like the SuperBowl.  

I’ve been avoiding you. Stray dogs cry into the tropical valley below. I should have  
said: a woman travels to a lake with her lover, then alone and she wakes up from a  
nap to the dark. The lake is unmoving, it doesn’t reflect anything. She leans out over  
the dock — is she alive? Is she alive?  

"
two mornings,"
    *1*

     Agreed. I sat in a house nearby this railroad. A place with two rooms I remember owning. I was cornered there a long time. Hunched over. Fishing in that stove for scraps I hid. Reminds me of

  

 eating. Or rather telling time. Not the stains or that purling in my gut, but the slow blood heavy in my fingertips, lingering underneath, those bloodbanks ready for hulling, as if they

  

 were an open

 space, as wide as

  a ruined barn

  

 that’s rented, battered or like a raw deal at ten o’clock in the morning, that’s repairing then chafing itself, each time dawn breaks, rasping. I hear it.

  

 *2*

 In that city, back in the far field of railroad yards, I turned up. Out of the inflamed river and burrowed into the bank’s slop. It was revealed what my sodden wallet held: some nickels

  

 I imagined gently being painted, my face on each one. There were times before now.

  

 Now is not happening

 again. The water is deserted

 by its river.

 **The Friday evening gas explosion in Springfield leveled a strip club next to a day care.**

 I remember the breeze right before…

 Burs of—was it willow—slant-falling.

 The gray sidewalk, schist granules, scattering. 

 A brown dumpster lid smushing its green plastic, sandwich meat. 

 A rat made its debut, but for a moment. 

  

 I remember an awning string’s knotted tip soft-thudding a windowpane

 —tympani’s uneven beat.

 The rustle of stray trash—bass strings, almost rising

 —but never. 

 And the chopper, the chopper—spittletatootling, spittletatootling— 

 A proud boot landing on obedient asphalt. 

 The stern, uncrying chrome. 

 The flighty flames decorative gas tank. 

  

 I can’t forget the beryllium blue sunshades

 —orange hued at a glance.

 And the stars and bars, starched, pressed, bandana. 

 Nation Idol Gorge

 A hawk’s claws claimed the stump.

  

 I remember two spouts of thin flame, blue, making an X

 The hissing of gurgling plastic, supplicant—sick

 The termite swarm at dusk, balling up, sprinkling.  

 A skeeter swirling in its hotel pool—for the first time.  

 A no-see-um bug popped out from nowhere—but for a moment—to romp.  

  

 I can’t say I recall Cleopatra’s hairpiece flying off in a speeding four-cylinder vehicle 

 —Empire of the Great Somewhere, but never.  

 And the flying fish, the flying fish—hither-flopping, hither-flopping—

 The carefree palms, twerking, injured.

 Tentative feet in knee high water, gripping.

 And the ample sized black pockadots—in my eyes, twerking, carefully.

disorderrabbit,"
I wore her  
disorder as a  
raincoat  
for the spring of tears.  
I took her voice.  
  
Shivering, I  
went over  
the insights of her diary  
with a pen  
in a fat blue book that made up  
for my not having  
a body that spring.  
  
I wanted to be the man she loved  
who loved her  
shivering.  I wanted to know what it’s like  
to have desire.  
  
* *  
I went off  
to find it  
in the desert,  
which is savage  
  
but where rabbits are.  
And ravens,  
wise enough to know  
you have a gun  
when you walk across the field.  
I never plowed that field.  
  
On the low road  
hardly visible  
I took that gun to where the old car carcasses  
lay, thick with  
rabbits, &  
I plowed that field.  
I didn’t leave a grave.  
  
  
  


"
inscription,"
Things traced by what they trace: the flashlight,

 not the slingshot...as though to orbit was the point.

  

 As though going round and round reiterating

 were a form of argument; the way a globe is spun;

  

 the way, cleaving the air, the boomerang must zip

 whatever it unzipped, the carousel horse gallop

  

 idiotically to its tune, its smile painted on.

 As though a beat was an adventure. The insufficient margin.

  

 The margin in all things makes them too valuable to be

 any value at all, the inscription To Chester, from Wystan

  

 that surplus in the chastity, To Chester; a line

 ruining, by embodying it, its potential power;

  

 remembered looking forward, as though not one minute more

 on the planet won’t be, and it won’t be, the undoing

  

 of everything I did, the boomerang returning, its limit shot,

 From Wystan, its limit never met, the horizon near

  

 my body worn as a light sweater, something thrown on

 on a cold night, getting colder, near the end of summer.

"
a sonnet eve was curious but bold,"
A sonnet.  Eve was curious but bold.

 Adam wondered if the branch above

 could hold her.  He watched Eve’s body unfold

 above and touch the fruit.  “I think this fruit

  

 was made,” she said.  He once

 regretted her, so limber, not content

 to name.  Chaos of time and dance…

 Adam engaged to teach her to relent:

  

 “The stars, their motions false, untimely.  Earth

 is here.  The triangle has properties

 no matter what.  The mind too can give birth

 to number, natural law, mythology.”

  

 The will to teach was gone.  The pomegranate

 seeds were gone.  They were gone.  A sonnet.

"
for soul is this,"
Sanctuary, I am light within  
your innermost organ: whitened

is the heart you assign to me,  
and I assume its shape with ease. 

 Breath comes to one from another,  
for soul is this remnant of expulsion 

 shriveled on body’s outskirts until  
elongating it rears up: guest ready 

 to love like only the shapeless  
can. This air is everywhere.

 These faces shape themselves  
from light swallowed by water.

 I feel river in my under-skull,  
tissue rinsed by currents eddying 

 around nerves. Turn your eyes,  
apparitions stream from them.

                          *

 Generations of me rush to the shores  
where, touched, your loss sinks below

lines of bodies falling, strapped,  
feet tied in bunches, where the hurling

 

sounds reach me here, where safety  
has gained remeaning unentirely.

 I do not know these sounds  
or their origin, only that my life 

 has spent itself searching  
for black clouds thick

 under skin, explosions boiling sky,  
poisons mixed like wild colors

 of sunset, intoxicating freedom:  
I am running, and when I hit 

 the confines of white-blinded  
skull, I make these sounds.

                          *

 There are no sounds these bodies make,  
there is the great flush cleansing 

 their eyes and sterilizing their pink  
mouths, there are rocks buried that 

 no one saw: these are the currencies  
of river’s gamblings, the game 

water plays with the sun: let us trade  
blindness for mineral abrasion, 

 

let us guess at the formulas this world  
reactively rearranged: numbers, bonds 

 flowing like lips between rage  
and desire. We can unite, I will pour 

 myself on top of you, river, and you  
will suffocate under ignition.

                          *

 I would not trade myself for anything.  
Time, your inflation was the mistake: 

 you submitted to the forceful massage,  
now you swell at speeds that distort 

 my explanation. I am your container,  
I nourish you, and I will turn away 

 in times of anguish. Do not desire me—  
desire is your premonition of loss. 

Speed from me, child: I am the river  
as light unarches.

"
swallows,"
Shards of exact memory, 

 masters of local 

 magnitude, keepers 

 of untranslating

 logic where

 eternity is 

 a wandering here — 

 these twining parallel 

 blindnesses 

 in future-outpacing 

 angles spelling 

 disintegration 

 of great intelligence: 

 carefullest madness, 

 black on blue, 

 black on clear, memory 

 everywhere proving 

 life whose will 

 still they scrawl still 

 they carve this easiest 

 element with fleet 

 illegibles 

 in circleshaming

 precision — bright-black

 thick air as if

"
elegy unearthed,"
 
 *For Charlottesville*

 My city, hardly a city, still  
 swimming like a newborn—  
 two winters into this dream  
 the streets feel pale and distant.  
 I made my room so clean last night  
 I thought I might disappear, folding  
 laundry until the space looked smaller  
 like something out of a children’s book.  
 Or like Meg’s window in the corner of the television.  
 Or like an engine in reverse but heard  
 through playback. Last night in the dark  
 something seemed to give, so I scraped the salt-licked brick  
 for the heat beneath. In the newer version of this dream  
 everything is still red and distant  
 and August finds bodies pressed to the street  
 like too many petals collapsing. Each husk unearthed, unfolded  
 in my two steady hands. My city, I am trying to write my way  
 back to you, but out here I remember  
 only echo or ghost. Or these hands  
 shaking, all through the night.  
 Even in the body each story ends  
 outside of the body, and here in snowy Boston  
 something is left buried. Easily, like broken glass. Like light  
 bouncing off the sidewalk.  

"
the other thing,"
Brief reprieve, then Junetime. The fledgling wins, just as\
it does every year. It rushes back rotten. When the last of\
the frost puddles, the bake-skinned child emerges, dumb\
       again. The echo in my drums again. Elena, Elena.\
     The once-remit light. I still answer to the name like a\
   dog. Pluck the petals, bald seeds, worry leaves thin. Each\
blinding summer, the re-christening among the spindly paint-\
brushes. I, running behind the barn. The dried wheat thins,\
the frivolous blooming fields, a round-bellied robin giving\
       chase. I’m tired of regrowth, the youth, the perpetual\
     youth, the weeds and the boy with the shade hat. Lying\
   peacefully atop my dull body, bugs landing heavy on their\
feet. I once held out my thumb, one brown eye closed, to blot\
out the sun. Just my little hand. Now the light tastes sour. The\
     barn has grown empty and wet. The mold spread there for\
   years, I’m told. When they were new, the pricks were clean,\
the sweet pear and cacti were shining and sweet. I place it all\
again as the light leaked this morning: every frenetic bone,\
     every tooth-lodged seed, the sun in my skin. Landing any-\
   where, light refracts broken onto me. Well, I opened my rickety\
fridge, the sudden cold relief, the wrinkles wrong. I ate every\
   cherry, let them bleed in my mouth, putrid, forcing the swallow.
