on Monday evening, bleeding between<br/>
bricks & concrete, indecisive direction, <br/>
improper & traversing. weight <br/>
lurching, we force forwards. when a prophet <br/>
makes a mistake, I am not equipped <br/>
to forgive. even if he asks. sweating, knees <br/>
buckling, bobbing. we plead. jolted over <br/>
curbs & branches, I recite the Lordâ€™s prayer<br/>
for the first time in ten years. somewhere,<br/>

a boulder stumbles off a cliff & hits <br/>
nothing on the way down. call &<br/>
echo as response. no trespass of mine has <br/>
been forgiven, Jeremiah shifts no <br/>
gears. uphill, wobbling, winded. light <br/>
splitting, we meet <br/>
the end. amen. shake hands, rinse <br/>
wounds. a red light in Asheville. small <br/>
rabbit in the beam. baby brother, bouncing baby, <br/>
your beautiful brother! yours. black snake <br/>
electrical cord. fan whirring down. how to speak.<br/>

black around neck. how to speak. winding <br/>
down. still brother, yours. look for no <br/>
transgression, look & it ends & it vaporizes. bearer<br/>
of bad news, mouthpiece of messages<br/>
bleeding between cracks. webbing between<br/>
fingers. veins inside ankles. call to me &<br/>
I will answer & yet I call wanting<br/>
silence in return. once I return<br/>
home, Jeremiah walks back alone. <br/>
