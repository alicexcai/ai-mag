*For LR*

  

 At first

 I saw just one light

 crisp blue

  

 line, nearly

 skylike, there, high above

 the rest

  

 of the stone,

 unkept, a bright slice

 of the

  

 fine mosaic

 sets, unstressed. I reached out:

 *Hey, look*

 * *

 *up, excuse me*

 *there, look up.*

  

 She looked

 like an exceptional criminal,

 or a cranial

  

 angel, or

 like something of a lazy

 hunter with

  

 eyes unmet.

 Faintly, she ground her

 shoulders

  

 down one

 by one, falling taut: *Look*

 *up, please,*

 * *

 *this is a very rare*

 *picture of the earth.*

  

 Then, I saw so

 many more, as if the blue slice

 said, ‘at once

  

 go’ or, ‘time

 for vespers,’ and all of the shy

 lines, the shier

  

 colors, burst

 forth and up, untaming, a light

 and limited

  

 take off not

 to space of course but to the very top

 and back:* Look*

 * *

 *up, my sister,*

 *look up, my sister.*

  

 Suddenly I saw

 that all of the lines were gone, even the sky-

 like first lit

  

 slice, gone, swift

 as a storm’s turn, and in the dark

 she looked

  

 just like the

 poet, but so much stonier than

 stone, a wax-

  

 ing statue for

 all beautiful men and stone, so I looked

 up: *Silhouette,*

 * *

 *linger me dimly,*

 *then extinguish.*
