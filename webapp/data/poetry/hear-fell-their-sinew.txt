& this sŭn birthed another

 with tears in her face -

 yellowed or gilded or faded or

 green - whatever the sun fancied

 for his willowed basement matter

 & this sŭn watched another

 with splinters at his sapling fingers

 from the wood in his veins -

 usher three men into the church

 where his mother wore her veils

 & this sŭn watched her

 yearn to flourish when showers came -

 unexpected - regular -

 and she grew with each one

 and she died for so much of each year

 & this sŭn saw a boy almost

 half the time - through mirrors - weeping

 as she had constantly taught him

 how to keep the wisps from lighting him

 afire - aflame - a glow, distantly

 & this sŭn called a meeting

 when he was gaunt - taut - white

 heat seeping from the crows in her smile

 with dreamt messes of unfeeling limbs

 - snap - bitten brittle - brittle together

 & this sŭn wept

 when he raised up the axe to

 chop down a mother - child

 for the gift of warm space

 where new sprouts could breach
