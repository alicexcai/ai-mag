*On wet grass *

 Coldness, the small knife splitting the bud,  
the wink of the shears cutting the hedge. The  
angel flattening its palm on grass, lifting its  
hand to show the gorgeous cross-tangle of  
morning, wet with predictions. The child’s  
mouth opening, the poppyseeds swirling,  
black wind-bound away from their red. 

 *On Anna Karenina *

 How delicately we use the word *ruthless*.  
The dancer wraps and unwraps this word  
round her torso like silk. And Anna’s body  
stretches onstage, neck tense, legs untender,  
train shrieking up through her spine, steam  
filling the throats of the audience.

 *On unrequited love *

 Pitiless line of white along the Scottish  
lake. Man throwing the split twig to the  
injured dog, the fissure in the water-rock.  
Two schoolboys with dirt-stained faces  
unbuttoning their uniforms. The smell of  
used-up flesh climbing the birch tree. 

 *On Nagy Diófa utca *

 The man with his cart sagging under plastic  
bags filled with rain. His pillow-case. The  
bookstore behind him, lit-up. The garden  
deep inside where sleepy children comb  
each other’s rain-wet hair.
