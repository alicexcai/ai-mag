  
 Given my hero worship  
 and your enthusiasm  
 let’s hit the road and  
 we can reshape

  

 American epistemology.  
 Of course we might ignore  
 active orders, turn and  
 escape, loose and free.

  

 But first open the trunk,  
 dig down deep, reach  
 your arm into the thing,  
 discover what’s of use, sunk

  

 to the bottom, and read.  
 There’s a new poem this  
 month, posthumous.  
 Take in the words. Breathe

  

 if you can hear them. Could  
 be a map, if you squint.  
 Tilt it at an angle,  
 shut your mind up good

  

 and tight, say it out loud,  
 scream it into the blistering  
 wind, think it. Think  
 it. It’s because we’re so sad

  

 that we left. It’s because  
 this ocean’s too close. It’s  
 not comfortable. It’s anything  
 but. Listen, please

  

 listen. Who cares if you’re  
 lonely, sick, depressed, a  
 poor excuse for citizenship.  
 When I look at you, for

  

 a moment I see myself

 transcribed the way  
 a mirror does it. All right. I’m  
 anything but. Or else

  

 we share a history,  
 harmonious or ugly.  
 A nightmare, a dream,  
 a hoax.

  

 So are you with me, are  
 you with me.
