I shall miss you. Drinking  
grass like  
that; a creature  
drinks  
from a stream  
its time  
& they feel  
their own trickle  
and warmth  
and wonder  
what’s that  
to know  

my own  
hug some  
how the  
language  
slipping  
the moon  
drink  
twice  
once in my throat  
once in my throat  
and once  
in my eyes  
it’s a new  
year  

How about it  
is sleep better  
than death  
is day better  
than night  
is love better  
than eternity  
are dogs  
better than  
cats  
is coffee  
what is coffee  
any groaning  
machine  
better than  
any chirping  
animal  
is a child  
better than a  
building  
is an unseeing  
woman  
better than not  
is heat  
better than  
ice cold  
day  
bright day  
better  
than telling  
the truth  
is truth  
the ugly  
thing you  
share  
is sharing  
beautiful  
or hurtful  
and cruel  
does a pen  
have words  
in any  
event  
endless  
are words  
like bullets  
tearing flesh  
announcing  
themselves  
what do they  
tell do hurtful  
words tell  
the end of something  
the body al  
ways cold  
the day was  
never new  
life is a prison  
how are you  
drinking that  
saying that  
writing that  
the puppets  
groan  
the heating  
clanks  
its OPEN  
to you  
a box or a vista  
a plate of cheeeeese
