 I remember the breeze right before…

 Burs of—was it willow—slant-falling.

 The gray sidewalk, schist granules, scattering. 

 A brown dumpster lid smushing its green plastic, sandwich meat. 

 A rat made its debut, but for a moment. 

  

 I remember an awning string’s knotted tip soft-thudding a windowpane

 —tympani’s uneven beat.

 The rustle of stray trash—bass strings, almost rising

 —but never. 

 And the chopper, the chopper—spittletatootling, spittletatootling— 

 A proud boot landing on obedient asphalt. 

 The stern, uncrying chrome. 

 The flighty flames decorative gas tank. 

  

 I can’t forget the beryllium blue sunshades

 —orange hued at a glance.

 And the stars and bars, starched, pressed, bandana. 

 Nation Idol Gorge

 But for a moment

 Then

 Boom.

 **The Friday evening gas explosion in Springfield leveled a strip club next to a day care.**

 I remember the plume right after…

 Orbs of—was it cinnamon—black-rising.

 Vapor gray whitening shingle powder rain. 

 A dumpster lid sheered off a gravestone’s angel face. 

 A hawk’s claws claimed the stump.

  

 I remember two spouts of thin flame, blue, making an X

 —mind’s waking dream.

 The hissing of gurgling plastic, supplicant—sick

 —stomach’s inner eyeball. 

 And the bathtub, the bathtub—sittin’ pretty—sittin’ pretty—

 The hysteric roof flopping on an unfazed floor. 

 The wise, ever-wakeful steel beams. 

 The cheery glass—beaming—everywhere. 

  

 I can’t forget that purple doorknob

 —horny at a glance.

 And the plump couch stuffing foam, blazing, angry. 

 City’s Final Chorus

 But for a moment

 Then

 Shsh.

 **The Friday evening gas explosion in Springfield leveled a strip club next to a day care.**

 I don’t remember the very moment…

 Flashes of—was I daydreaming—Biloxi Bound.

 The termite swarm at dusk, balling up, sprinkling.  

 A skeeter swirling in its hotel pool—for the first time.  

 A no-see-um bug popped out from nowhere—but for a moment—to romp.  

  

 I can’t say I recall Cleopatra’s hairpiece flying off in a speeding four-cylinder vehicle 

 —Empire of the Great Somewhere, but never.  

 And the flying fish, the flying fish—hither-flopping, hither-flopping—

 The carefree palms, twerking, injured.  

 The bald, unyielding sun, giddy.  

 Tentative feet in knee high water, gripping.

  

 Have I forgotten the name of that triple IPA—something like

 —Rondez The Moon à la Batshit.

 And the ample sized black pockadots—in my eyes, twerking, carefully.

 Empire of the Great Somewhere 

 But for a moment

 Then 

 Then
