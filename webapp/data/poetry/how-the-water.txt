HOW  
Water heals the passage of whatever breaks  
through it. And quickly. It heals the passage  
and the break immediately. Corrects flesh  
or vegetable. Heals indiscriminately.   
The fish’s memory corrects each second   
  
cleanly. Erases it. That means   
‘abides by the water.’ So the school  
is the space between fish surrounding it.   
So the mind clears. So it polishes  
a single principle. So salmon   
  
and trout run, so the schooled fish  
synchronize. That way their passage  
continues the water. Or furthers it.   
Schools of wrasses that consume hosts’  
parasites. Called, ‘cleaning them.’ Healing  
  
the fish by reduction. Or, further, wrass  
mimics that erase the distinction. Consume  
host and parasite. And indiscriminately.   
The water heals the fish it bears  
indiscriminately. It corrects them so it clears.   
  
HOW  
No, no, there are no others. The lid wrinkles   
and breaks. The light shuffles down towards, no, we   
are the crystal veins and bones and have  
no vision. The sea vegetables loll their limp strands  
uselessly. A line draws no border. The small   
muscles school here, curl and flexing.   
As those behind a face, but the face blank   
always. So synapses glow to shed light   
cautiously. So we taper. So we tend towards  
the water dumbly. The water smoothes and tapers  
away from expression. So the current here seeks no exit.
