&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *“They ate their own children.”*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *—Yang Jisheng, on The Great Famine*  

<br>
In an hour it will be summer  
A time to admire wild things  
But all our sparrows are shot  
Left in heaps of rotting trash  

So in the dark where no one is  
Awake I dig their bones back  
Let you slurp on chicken stew  
Pretend I still remember truth  

As I skin these bodies one after  
Another &nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning I say  
They are visiting your mother  
Gifting us silence &nbsp;&nbsp; And dinner  

Is now gray water rice a long  
Minute of constant lies saying  
Words that will be thrown out  
Set on fire hoping a few stray  

Feathers fall on my skin keep  
Me warm and safe as the soil  
Burns then maybe I will grab  
Hold you tight succumb to the  

Terrible &nbsp;&nbsp; But I taught you how  
To run away when the smoke  
Grows closer &nbsp;&nbsp; To always look  
Up &nbsp;&nbsp; Write down what I forgot.
