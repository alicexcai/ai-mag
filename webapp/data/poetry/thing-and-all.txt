I don’t exactly think I will.  
I don’t exactly wish I don’t.  
The science is inexact, and don’t  
Think it won’t splice you  
As you swish by  
On your two-stroke motor  
Scooter with your bright visor  
Held aloft for all to topple.  
Your orbit is unseeming.  
It takes you in, like a market  
Spilling futures  
On the livestock you are  
On the soybeans you aspire to  
And the husks and straws  
Baking your energy  
Into meticulous kitty litter crypto 
Currency in the metabolic  
Cycle you were born for:  
Come and see yourself  
By and by, baby-naked and  
Time-begrimed  
In your coin-op space scope.  
Its azimuth is lacking  
Its optics are exacting  
And can smother  
Grainy eggs of the tiniest  
Horned reptile  
Secreted in the stream bed  
You once took to.  
It might feel like something  
To feel something capturing you 
In milled mirroring lenses  
As you are and would be  
But that self-love is  
Nostalgia.
