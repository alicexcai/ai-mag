Eel as   
if there is a  
care such  
that a   
syllable can  
bridge it  
without.  
  


Eel, is   
there one  
sea to  
make or  
is one to  
throw in  
an other?  
  


About tender:  
will I have  
had room?  
Or does  
the col-  
lation disjoin   
that need  
to know?  
  


At least it  
can now be  
said that if  
fusion is  
room-making  
then we have  
either the eel  
or the ocean.
