I am filling the creases on your neck   
and your palms, from which sand

once rose, as from the creases of   
a sidewalk where a parched wind

wrestles. The unfolding of   
your back revels in its grace as though

it were a sickness, or falling   
leaves curling around

a current of air. My hands   
falling on yours, my hands

on your unfolding back,   
especially on your unfolding back,Â 

become poplar leaves. That I cannot   
hide in a crease your smile

makes in your cheek is   
my one regret as I let my eyes

shut out the light: unseen,   
it will dissolve the gentle weight

of distances. I know how to   
stop and start at the brim.
