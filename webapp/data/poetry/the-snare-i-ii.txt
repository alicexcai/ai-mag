**The Snare (I)**

 

Please shut up. When I emerge wild,

 the golden lake over my shoulder,

 I will take into account the promise

 you entangled me in.

  

 1.

 Similar to the negative torso

 holding up the tree roots

 I ask you to be gentle.

  

 Everything will wobble

 otherwise               When you’re not here

  

 something crawls into the hole

 and doesn’t think.

  

 Patience is expendable.

 Go deeper with me.

 Break any final symmetry.

  

 2.

 I think this body is an instrument.

  

 I grow like a graft.

 It might be useless

 to try to place

 what stucco home

 sprung me fully formed.

 How often I thought

 of my network of parts.

 And I thought of yours.

  

 Wheeling we get married

 and I use my new mechanisms.

  

  

 **The Snare (II)**

  

 How do we know

  

 how to send the codes from one end

 to the other of the last sunken terminal?

  

 If I were to lie down and go to pieces

 I could imitate the echo in the marl.

  

 *** 

  

 A lord’s hand made me whole again,

 my corpse the fledgling map of the new world.

  

 A lord smiles like a turning wing

 and hovers over noon churning.

  

 All the parts were plain to see, the parish,

 the barnyards, veins and ligatures.

  

 They cover me with hay

 until I am gone.

  

 These locusts buried in the riverbank. They hatch 

 and fly further. They cluster with force,

 they eddy and course into my yawn.
