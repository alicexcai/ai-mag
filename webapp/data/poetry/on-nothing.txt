  
I wanted to know there was nothing.  
I kept knocking. When I touched  
the door with my palm the wood froze.  
When I called your name you slept behind  
drifts of rain for nine hours.  
There was snow in everything I spoke.  
Your eyes filled with the green paralysis of  
trees, months of wind at our lips.  
Please donâ€™t worry. The bell  
that once rose from my throat  
in breath below you blurs into the night.  
I have less than I had when I first saw you.
