Sanctuary, I am light within  
your innermost organ: whitened

is the heart you assign to me,  
and I assume its shape with ease. 

 Breath comes to one from another,  
for soul is this remnant of expulsion 

 shriveled on body’s outskirts until  
elongating it rears up: guest ready 

 to love like only the shapeless  
can. This air is everywhere.

 These faces shape themselves  
from light swallowed by water.

 I feel river in my under-skull,  
tissue rinsed by currents eddying 

 around nerves. Turn your eyes,  
apparitions stream from them.

                          *

 Generations of me rush to the shores  
where, touched, your loss sinks below

lines of bodies falling, strapped,  
feet tied in bunches, where the hurling

 

sounds reach me here, where safety  
has gained remeaning unentirely.

 I do not know these sounds  
or their origin, only that my life 

 has spent itself searching  
for black clouds thick

 under skin, explosions boiling sky,  
poisons mixed like wild colors

 of sunset, intoxicating freedom:  
I am running, and when I hit 

 the confines of white-blinded  
skull, I make these sounds.

                          *

 There are no sounds these bodies make,  
there is the great flush cleansing 

 their eyes and sterilizing their pink  
mouths, there are rocks buried that 

 no one saw: these are the currencies  
of river’s gamblings, the game 

water plays with the sun: let us trade  
blindness for mineral abrasion, 

 

let us guess at the formulas this world  
reactively rearranged: numbers, bonds 

 flowing like lips between rage  
and desire. We can unite, I will pour 

 myself on top of you, river, and you  
will suffocate under ignition.

                          *

 I would not trade myself for anything.  
Time, your inflation was the mistake: 

 you submitted to the forceful massage,  
now you swell at speeds that distort 

 my explanation. I am your container,  
I nourish you, and I will turn away 

 in times of anguish. Do not desire me—  
desire is your premonition of loss. 

Speed from me, child: I am the river  
as light unarches.
