*—for Patrick Pethybridge*  
<br>

, the no-tongue bell  
, the urn-mouth against the earth  
, dream in which I would not sing  
, though many asked me to sing  
, slept warm in the stable straw  
, with my head on a lamb breathing  
, a full-grown lamb  
, the bell around the cow’s neck  
, did not ring  
, the bell was sleeping  
, dreaming that it would not ring  
, goat mouth asleep in the hay  
, the dream of eating hay
