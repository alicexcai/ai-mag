Honey locust and the fishing rod.  
Hook silvered creek.  

You say a river baptized your grandpa.  
And from the canopy of branches,  

you step into this purl of rain  
to hold a bream like a sheet of copper.  

Gods change things all the time.  
Your feet into cattails, fingers ox eyesâ€”  

tomatoes lipped on spun vines.  
Hold one, cut one. Who knew light could do that?  

Each summer, you are one chalked fir  
snagged on a feral green hill.  

The heavy rust rattle of cicadas.  
Three hawks in the brush.  

If not the moon,  
then a word for it.  

Who knew what sons we might have in spring?  
Mine, the warm glide of his hair.
