Until the moth takes  
wing light on dark  
on your dark eye  
 I cannot express.

Hold up a flashlight  
to things themselves;  
separate the body  
into day and night.

Across your screen  
the moth wings  
are many and pressings  
wrinkled hands cupping

and dropping the dark.  
Overhead a light  
aurora performs its  
handless weavings.

 These are our angels:  
the luminous who sing  
in light of things  
 as they truly are.

That your dark eye  
wing light on dark  
might tear a part  
for the daytime

 I reach overhead.  
 I caress the mothlight  
and with its dust  
I mark my breath.
