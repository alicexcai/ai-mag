The philosophers say there are words  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that do things, make themselves  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; real in the world,  
so that when you said  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I promise,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you had to have meant it  
and when together you said *I do*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bond was real in every sense.  

Those are the examples, but there are others  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like when I said *I’m queer*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it did something – not to you  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (tho I guess a little bit to you)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but to my world and my body  
and when you first taught me the word  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *woman*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *man*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that did something too.  

I think these words are the closest real thing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to prayer. To toss a stone across  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the frozen pond and see if it smash  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open or skip with grace and stop.  

But my voice will not hold my body.  
And I don’t know if I can speak *transition*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or swallow it.  

Tell me, can I say  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am?*
