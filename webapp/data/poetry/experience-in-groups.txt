What is language is a new needed

 For the going on part of the end 

 You can tell has made it here because

  

 The air is with condition

 The outside seems to be like anything

 Placed in a lab or subway car

  

 The truths are showing through

 The people have chosen to be

 Each moves along fresh tracks

  

 On the erasable surface

 Toward a tiny destiny

 Wearing vraiment raiment

  

 It’s maybe three days after

 Or exactly during seeing

 The future put on its certainties

  

 I want of the opposite to speak

 To say what isn’t etymology, won’t

 Be money to the king above my eye

  

 Reach out to the invisible third

 Among every two pedestrians

 Where belonging bucks its norms

  

 Difference lives in the least places

 Shine caught in the multiple

 Lie of any kind of hair

  

 You can’t tell if it’s order or not

 To follow the too many paths

 Just above the face, below sky

  

 Long enough to forget or be

 Distracted from the big geographies

 Where truth first learned of us

  

 In the pit of an education

 In the skysick life of power

 In its moving rearrangements

  

 I was walking on Mission Street

 In love with you while damage bloomed

 The right order right in the words

  

 Below the preserved fade of marquees

 The little sale of needless things

 Listing bodies listed just past

  

 It was far too easy to get here

 Standing still while white time flowed

 Around its professional mourners

  

 Comfortable in end after end

 The next one isn’t very pretty

 At least we’ll see how together

  

 It provides absent alternatives

 My plan to put my body between

 Where it already was and is going
