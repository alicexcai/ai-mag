Hand over hand, fishermen hauled cod, haddock, \
flattened slippery silver against drying walls.

Below the lichen sea-cliff – a ghost fishing \
village. Huts arc around the black pearl cove. 

Along this coast every boulder repeats a story: \
Kerling implored her husband, out of earshot,

“Don’t leave me stranded at the ocean’s edge.” \
The trout bundle on her back slowed her down.

I lose track of mine as the winds pick up.  \
Witnessing the sun at daybreak, she turned to stone.

The fishermen threw dice of walrus teeth. Snake Eyes. \
Last night, by a fire, I lost every round.

Inside the rock, spirits bellow to escape. \
Like herds of stallion, waves stampede the shore.

Buffeted by high winds, I hear his shout, \
while beneath, shoals of quick fish ghost the depth.
