The service must have just ended, \
because the boys in their dark suits

and the girls in their skirts and dresses \
were spilling through the open doors  

as I walked home, Sunday \
in the late morning, wet light shining 

on the church’s stucco wall, the heavy white blossoms \
nodding from the rain just stopped, and the wet earth

surprisingly soft \
each time I stepped from the sidewalk to the bordering grass 

to avoid someone on the crowded pavement, and I was thinking how \
Brooklyn was  

nearly a year behind us now, each day’s long walk \
to the long wait for the late train 

to take me to work, the small apartment with the black balcony \
where the red birds gathered  

and one or the other of us sat smoking \
in the evening, or after we had argued,  

and were we happy now, I wondered— \
turning up the front steps— 

but hadn’t we gotten everything we’d wanted?
