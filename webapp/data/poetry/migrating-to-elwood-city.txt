*after Sue Ellen*

Here, trees tap-dance like the ghosts  
of nomads – red curls, invisible  
hands, fear, everything else  
that adults cannot see. Confection  
across the housetop – do you think  
they have kids? Here’s what it’s like  
to come from a sugarless world.  
Now I migrate between cavities, thread tongue between  
lips, hear screaming  
down the streets. I promise, invisible  
people won’t chase you  
down the streets, if they have kids,  
anyway. There’s been a heist  
at the art museum – is it the immigrant?  
the child? the security guard? None  
of those, really. I can’t roll  
the Mona Lisa into my backpack  
or conquer the world. Even spaceships  
are made of earth-metals. I wonder how many lies  
can thrive in one town. They die  
away, soon.
