God gave me a man  
Who I, in turn, bodied.  
Had he lived, I would  
Take myself more seriously.  
Come what may I will  
Get myself together,  
I will whip myself into  
The shape of a man  
Who has put away  
Childish things. I will  
Take a woman as my toy  
And pretend, in doing so,  
Iâ€™m highly favored.
