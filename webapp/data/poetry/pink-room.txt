We are contemporaries, born in  
the worst plague year for our kind.  
It is May, locust shells in the screen doors.  
The surf is thick with ash. An unnamed man  
roams the beach, looking for a place  
deep inside himself, like a room lined in silk.  
You are a piece of shit, like me.  
Between us, three ceramic teeth  
glued to our jaws. I leave my hair curly  
for seven months. I love you because you canâ€™t be destroyed by love;  
we are immune  
to one another: my perfect Tennyson, your fingers  
tearing the metal strings of a guitar. We stop  
wearing underwear, spring lays its dust over everything,  
flies climb our naked shoulders.
