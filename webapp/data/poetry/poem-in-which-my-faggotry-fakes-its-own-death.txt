On the eighth day, coquelicot, <br/>
wearing my Armageddon earring,<br/>

my faggotry jumped to its death<br/>
from the foam spire of its death.<br/>

& on the ninth: in paradise, titmice <br/>
scrubbed its pearls with aftermath flax.<br/>

From its suicide note: So men might <br/>
once again flip you buffalo nickels.<br/>

The being inside my having been so <br/>
delicately razed itself into wondrous pink.<br/>

Meaning my faggotry carried all of astrology <br/>
& I wanted only the varmint baubles,<br/>

little sex cowlick with which I coaxed<br/>
maw into morrow, morrow into morning.<br/>

How many times could I wake like that:<br/>
gowns & waxwings, the paler gust before<br/>

the gust that everyone remembers with a notch<br/>
in the wall when a prodigal boy molts past his pastness?<br/>

How many times could I join the hundred<br/>
apocryphal boys nursing their empire stitch?<br/>

Their faggotries, too, nixed themselves<br/>
with lovability’s long & bedazzled shears:<br/>

drowned in a tub filled with pink milk,<br/>
Alice’d by an extra-large bottle of Rush.<br/>

To build trust, we plunged the javelin of fey<br/>
suspicion, deep & darkling, inch by inch,<br/>

deeper into each other. I think we sought<br/>
a new unto, as in the boys we barely let <br/>

ourselves struggle to be, as in two yuan<br/>
pieces, silver & tinkling, nearly crushing<br/>
each other into the bottom of a celadon<br/>
demitasse given as a gift by a lover who,<br/>

nightly, conspired to push our faggotry<br/>
from the glottal stopgap of the word<br/>

he never said but always meant: not fickle, no, <br/>
not fanged—but blood, yes, & its heavy shimmer.
