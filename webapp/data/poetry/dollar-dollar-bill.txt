One more Jacobean kiss  
and you’ll wind up related to me.  
One more emotion  
and I’m coming for you, like a sparrow.  
Set your phenomenology  
on the windowsill.  
Filthy, meet Family. Family,  
I want to get marketable again.  
In the mean time, what are your thoughts  
on a completely male garden?  
As little closure, maybe, as there is  
a permanence? This being, also, the time  
of the wandering Miss Americas.  
Loose thumb-bones, rattling  
in a mint tin. One more emotion  
and both Dakotas will explode.  
One more condition  
and I’ll be exiting my relevance.  
And what was it, finally,  
so dead about him, Family?  
I think I just saw a fox.  
Yes, with its little foxen teeth,  
like Ezekiel’s. Of course, you were off busy,  
revising your plague journals.  
Bringing clock to the belt-line  
of Orion. What could’ve you done  
about the remaining days  
no longer outnumbering us?  
Voice of the dying groupie  
like a deck of cards being shuffled.  
One last electromagnetic pulse,  
one last electromagnetic pulse,  
and the neutral bodies of the dead  
dropping from our larger, living bodies.  
The truth? I thought the castration threat  
a touch on the heavy side of the tonality.  
But you got your point across.  
And by then, we were a much  
cleaner people, anyway.
