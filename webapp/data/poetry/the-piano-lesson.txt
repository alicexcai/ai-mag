            after Henri Matisse

  

 I. 

 Hope of the boy’s 

 hidden hands that they meet

  

 at the final triangle’s 

 point, the key

  

 II. 

 The twice-painted women 

 are strung silent.

  

 The boy sits in air’s 

 clear fire between

  

 wrought music stand, 

 wrought railing. The scene

  

 orients around 

 the unseen bodiless

  

 dancer the women 

 are bodies of.

  

 III. 

 The wrought railing 

 strains for the world 

 of green the world 

 of time – in this house

  

 sheer cliffs, the window’s 

 slice of green a slice 

 of time, a sharp absent 

 point on the burnt piano-top 

 where the metronome mocks 

 the candle, taps

 its own candlelife out 

 in unlovely coughs

 as the candle lost 

 in its shining locks 

 is too much song, 

 is not hope

  

 IV. 

 The two mothers guard 

 the depthless walls 

 of the past he purges 

 now in song:

  

 with the rest 

 of the brightened dead 

 they inhabit hope –

  

 V. 

 And now his fierce eye 

 confounds its shape 

 in a shadow honing

  

 into evening, 

 narrowing, lengthening 

 into nothing

  

 VI. 

 Must I misshape time? 

 To another canyon, 

 another imagined point?

  

 O say the boy’s hands, 

 strong with gathered gaze, 

 meet that backwards eye
