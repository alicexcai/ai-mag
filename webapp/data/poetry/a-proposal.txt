honeydew, hold me—\
haggle over my seeds \
with your\
own— flower 



over hovering \
above hinging \
upon you—\
I like you in



slices I like you\
upholstered in a \
hell on Hollywood \
Boulevard hatted 



so lowly and \
heavily\
no one knows \
who you



could be \
honeydew—I like you\
never in Manhattan\
hot & heaving



sweating on \
my forehead in my \
hair welled in \
neck’s hollow—



when do\
you hurt— \
in these hallucinations\
of mine you are always



bleeding\
and always smear it on me—\
it happens\
at the thresh-\

<br>
<br>
<br>

hold—\
I would like to be held\
you would too\
in this sunlight



I handcraft and embroider\
what I am trying \
to say to you. you do\
very well.
