    *God is a set*

 *of certain values.*

 *He is the values*

 *and they are him.*

  

 We are one

 and the same.

 He, if he punctures

 my face with leathery

  

 hands. Me, when I slam

 through the glass

 library door, and puncture

 my mouth with a cigarette.

  

 I become the library but it

 is not me. I am not yet defined.

 Define is a proposition. I swear

 I couldn’t read until the tenth

  

 grade, and not because

 I was locked away,

 but because of my occupation

 pouring concrete or playing

  

 basketball. *The set must*

 *follow a rule. The*

 *predicate and the subject*

 *must be in an order.*

 * *

 *The Bad Man is just*

 *God with an empty set.*

 *He is not God, and God*

 *is not him, but God is*

 * *

 *that set of values that will*

 *get lost the next time you*

 *misplace it or forget*

 *to pass it on to your children.*

 * *

 *The Bad Man becomes*

 *the hereditary trait and mixes*

 *with God’s set. Soon, there*

 *is no set or no God, but only*

 * *

 *empty. They become each*

 *other, and the doors, and my*

 *father. The bad man is God*

 *if his set were empty.* I become

  

 my body, the communion,

 you, take it as the sacrifice.

 I am the bad man, and he

 is I, but we are not one.

  

 He, if he takes

 his leathery hands

 and slams them through

 me, even though I know

  

 they are my hands too,

 and even if I shout, father,

 I am me. *God cannot*

 *shout this, he is one*

 * *

 *with his set. So his*

 *shout is the same*

 *as his words and his father*

 *and his hands are not*

 * *

 *leathery, because he is perfect,*

 *or at the very least*

 *he is constrained to be.*

 Unlike me, he is

  

 the boundary and his

 very own set, and he

 doesn’t need to shout,

 *Father, why have you*

 * *

 *got hands that are so*

 *leathery when you haven’t*

 *once left the office, other*

 *than to drive home too*

 * *

 *fast and drink a little*

 *too much and touch your*

 *hand to my face, too fast*

 *for affection, with your hands that you*

 * *

 *haven’t ever washed or knelt*

 *down to take communion*

 *the right way, like me,*

 *without belief in God,*

 * *

 *Father, I am you*

 *and me but I am only*

 *me, the bad man.* He is God. 

 He is an empty set.
