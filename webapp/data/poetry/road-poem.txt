One of the horses was dead and it made for a \
start to the day. Warm for the month for the year \
so far. The kind that comes with sun and rain and \
rain with lightning. That kills horses. Apparently. \
I didn’t see the horse. I saw your face cave and \
saw it come back. There’s no good antonym for \
caving. Some things take work and time. You \
narrow your eyes when you look far ahead. Your \
pupils contract in the sunlight. Then you smile. \
The future is mostly a whole lot of physiological \
change. And expectation. And then some. When \
I think about death my stomach hurts. When I \
think about horses I am usually wrong. I thought \
horses stood while they slept, but they can sleep \
lying down. Bodies at rest become bodies at \
work. Even decay can be no easy feat. Requires \
work and time. Are we like or unlike horses. We \
are not like this horse. This horse is different. \
This horse is dead. But the field looks greener \
than it looked before. The water pools where our \
feet have moved the earth. It pools on the road. It \
doubles us. I want to know if there is ever \
enough symmetry. At Trader Joes the answer to \
symmetry is lots. Pastels, gold lettering. I want to \
buy an orchid. $12.99 in a ceramic, purple vase. \
It feels like they’re reading my mind. When my \
card is declined the staff is kind. They say it \
happens to all of us but it’s happening to me. I \
feel like I’m watching myself watch the horse. \
But the grass is very green.
