after the night

 drowns, it opens 

 the forest, pale green forest, ajar

 and watered by the blooming.

  

 if I try, I can always reconstruct

 the things that are most 

 important. today, home 

 is this measure 

  

 of ground. thrown shutter 

 of branches strewn 

 into cover, each color breaking 

 the seams, tensed

  

 in their dew and refracted as 

 a parched red in brown shadowed 

 and swallowed by 

 a canopy roof seen

  

 from below. the trees empty themselves

 to the ground, 

 their figures rotting 

 as winnowed outlines rent

  

 in all direction. the same image

 that reaches into my lungs and 

 takes. pulling away

 my inside. pulling the fear that I

  

 had missed the coming

 until I had already arrived. a feeling 

 as small and as bare as

 the process of a home. 

  

 I am aware 

 of all of this. I 

 am accepting. it,

 coming lightened by

  

 its own absence, in the morning, 

 when all other morning things are still

 undisturbed. the quiet

 fastening of self-

  

 poverty. as the dew formed overnight

 in the folds of a palm fall and 

 will split, bearing away the progress

 overhung. so yes.

  

 please, yes. for this, 

 tomorrow and 

 tomorrow, I will continue 

 to walk for as long

  

 as the edges 

 can bear to hold.
