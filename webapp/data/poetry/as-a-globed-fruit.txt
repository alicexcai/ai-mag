This time, I want it to be simple: say you are  
a fresh, cool lemon. Your rind is dotted with wet.  

Say I have a tongue and lick away the wetness,  
have hands and excavate the seeds.  

I pull you out of yourself. I raise newness.  
Everything tastes yellow and the sea-line is a line  

down my throat. The lemon is a line across  
the sky and that too is what you are: everything  

mistaken for something else, the citrus getting larger, blooming.  
Are you blooming? Are you in bloom? Tell me how you feel.  

You don’t have to be a lemon if you don’t want to.  
The rind could slip from my hand, if you asked for it.  

I only want to speak to you. I’ve known lemons before:  
tendrils of fruit clutching to the white, hand unhooked,  

every cold, flowered thing giving way to water. Things change  
when I speak and fruits flower, open slowly, without knowing it.  

Try this: the dig of your finger under stem, stopping  
crooked between flesh and peel. So what if when I dream  

I dream citrus? I can taste even the farthest slick of air,  
unlace semblance from skin. I can feed in pieces.  

When I call out your name, it is your name  
before it is anything else.  

Later, I can ask you about the rest.
