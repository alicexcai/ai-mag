My left hand digging in my pocket. Three days ago a\
Chevy parked outside the garage, waiting for the stars to\
bleed into the ready ground. The clouds never rise: they\
film the skies white. My hand scooping the wind, shoveling\
light to make way. Then the mechanic, the shaking leg, the\
loving familiar pain. The truck coughs final. Every arm\
snapped—even young—heals slow. But we salvaged scrap.\
The heavy hand, the girl. Today, the new sky. The first seen\
cloud, the sun going quick. My pockets shrank fast. My\
father buried far, my tiny hands big. Sun’s coming, sore\
eyes. Don’t look yet.
