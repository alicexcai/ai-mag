I pick my gap-toothed cunt up off the floor.

 I can feel it in my lap, trembling there

 like a small insect. 

  

 Oh cut the crap dear cunt, I tell it. 

 The time it took the ocean to carve this valley,

 that was one day in the life of a cunt.

  

 Cunt of cordage and rigging, of shock

 and sigh of wave. Then, yes—

 with such strangeness it opens,

  

 gives name to the sounds that rise early

 at my window: wind and leaf

 and leafblower and the opened husk 

  

 of sun. The cunt could name mountains,

 but its paper wings just beat and beat.
