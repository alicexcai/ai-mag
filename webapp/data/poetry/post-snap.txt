you are still pericles—

  wailing nations of id,

 you will assure them,

  

 ‘just chemicals’

 even,  that all that greens

  inside your bulbs—it rancid,

 it dastardly savor. narrowing

  

  nations, and you got that

  itch to dance crushing

  underfoot infant

 nodes of energy. they compelled to

  

 death-wish undertow, they

 hide themselves—in the ruins—

  

  if you don’t do well with

  diorama, this earth is not

 for you.

  

  this has always

  been the same—

 ajax showed you, continuity

  

 is a cult of personality and you

  will subscribe.

  

  onion-headed or not.
