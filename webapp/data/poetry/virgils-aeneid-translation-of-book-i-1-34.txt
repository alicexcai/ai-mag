I sing of arms and the man whom fate had sent  
To exile from the shores of Troy to be  
The first to come to Lavinium and the coasts  
Of Italy, and who, because of Juno’s  
Savage implacable rage, was battered by storms  
At sea, and from the heavens above, and also  
Tempests of war, until at last he might  
Build there his city and bring his gods to Latium,  
From which would come the Alban Fathers and  
The lofty walls of Rome. Muse, tell me  
The cause why Juno the queen of heaven was so  
Aggrieved by what offence against her power,  
To send this virtuous faithful hero out  
To perform so many labors, confront such dangers?  
Can anger like this be, in immortal hearts?

There was an ancient city known as Carthage  
(Settled by men from Tyre), across the sea  
 And opposite to Italy and the mouth  
 Of the Tiber river; very rich, and fierce,  
Experienced in warfare. Juno, they say,  
 Loved Carthage more than any other place  
 In the whole wide world, more even than Samos.  
Here’s where she kept her chariot and her armor.  
It was her fierce desire, if fate permitted, that  
Carthage should be chief city of the world.  
But she had heard that there would come a people,  
Engendered of Trojan blood, who would some day  
Throw down the Tyrian citadel, a people  
Proud in warfare, rulers of many realms,  
Destined to bring down Libya. Thus it was  
That the Parcae’s turning wheel foretold the story.

Fearful of this and remembering the old  
 War she had waged at Troy for her dear Greeks,  
And remembering too her sorrow and her rage  
Because of Paris’s insult to her beauty,  
Remembering her hatred of his people,  
 And the honors paid to ravished Ganymede –  
For all these causes her purpose was to keep  
The Trojan remnant who’d survived the Greeks  
And pitiless Achilles far from Latium,  
 On turbulent waters wandering, year after year,  
Driven by fates across the many seas.

So formidable the task of founding Rome.
