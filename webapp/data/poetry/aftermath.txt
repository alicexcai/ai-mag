1.   
Not understanding   
what I was I

took a piece out   
of my side and

smashed it   
and diffused it through

the hole in what   
had been my side

beginning to see   
myself though   
faintly still just

catching at   
myself. I

was dust. And   
distance, distance

descried by   
dust. I am

no longer together, I   
said, perhaps I am

free. And I

ignited then.

2.

Some parts I

remember. For   
example, when I drew

out from bleared dark   
alive my shape, alive

how it trembled   
dark to

pieces. Later, how   
my many bodies   
swam together,

silvering. And I   
remember the stitch of

dusk, the dew

that rose to meet   
my instep arch. The first

time I flew. The first time   
I was afraid.

3.

I have given   
 the last of my

dreams away   
to the separate   
animals. They

do not know me, who   
 am them. And I

do not recall

building this city, its   
 black water blooming

on its walls. I must   
have placed one

stone upon a stone,   
and then another stone

upon a stone,   
the dust motes as I

did it crying fool, and   
 crying star, crying

let go, let

go, and then just go,   
and then just

o.
