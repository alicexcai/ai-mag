At some point  

I had a swollen muscle  

)or a body  

that pretended to be  

one swollen muscle)  

Loaned to me by a tuft of sugar cane  

I don’t know how to hold sweetness  

or vastness the right way  

Like a poacher caressing dirt  

before cutting for some long absent bone  

What I’ve been able to hold has long  

been lost in a hole of the white  

porcelain of one whole universe’s heirlooms  

Cartography is just the  

impulse to jump  

off of things  

The righteous have since discovered  

a black hole with its maw wide open  

Who can compete  

with that kind of devotion?  

I certainly can’t  

My stomach  

Won’t hold any more of  

The universe’s ash  

I’ll cough it up in the yard  

Next to the ire and the musk  

and the citrus tree  

While the man across the street  

gives audience with pillaging eyes  

At my wither  

at my pinked failure  

Who will hold my hair  

when that love escapes  

my mothering tendon  

Who will hold me through  

All my wretched
