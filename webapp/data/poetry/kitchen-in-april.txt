Little sister listens,  
solemn, to my tap  
of egg on silver-lipped bowl.  
It cracks the way ice does,  
lined as the palm of my hand.  
Just beneath the shards of white:  
filmy membrane, milk-colored.  
Stretches and tears  
like a mother  
to release the golden yolk.  
Never knew it was there,  
slick as frogskin.  
Never knew how easy  
it is to cut into something:  
in the grade school science lab,  
scalpel and blue  
rubber gloves.  
Organs like glass beads  
glowing in a veil of formaldehyde.  
I’m baking lemon cake for my mother.  
She loves the tingle  
on her tongue, sharp smell  
of furniture polish.  
Glassy wood of her first bedroom set,  
and I, nestled haploid within  
like so many white orbs  
in pink styrofoam.  
The whites drip over my fingers  
like spit or tears or breaking water.  
I can feel their aching,  
as I ached each month  
at thirteen, my body so empty  
it poured itself out.  
My sister holds the bowl  
in her bugbitten arms  
as I scrape batter into the pan  
with its grease-glow.  
She, yolk-gold, sun-gold,  
our small bright thing. Strawberry  
freckle on her nose.  
The year my mother birthed her  
was the year I learned  
of the eggs inside me.  
Little halves of would-be daughters,  
girls before they’re touched.  
Mama taught me their genesis,  
growing like grapes within me  
while I was within her.  
How baby sister,  
small enough to shatter,  
carries them, too,  
already,  
in her soft pink abdomen:  
womb within womb, echo of blood.
