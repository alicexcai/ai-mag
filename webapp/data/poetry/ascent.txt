Down by the creek

           named for its sweat-

 scented roots, my sister taught me

           to relieve the ache I imagined

 God gave only the wicked. Here

           is where to place

 your touch, your breath, your troubling

           assent. Delight

 relived--the anticipated end

           of our exploit--came with gloaming, 

 the appearance of lives

           you don't see lived in

 full sun. The swallow

           you cannot name. (What I've learned

 to call pleasure is more

           akin to belief.) My sister slouched

 over when the soughing

           ceased, said, no one has to know

 this place exists.
