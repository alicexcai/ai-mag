(For Sarah)
<br>
<br>

The last poem I will ever write \
will be like the first dream I ever

wrote down, when I was green like a lawn \
that did not know it was not the world,

I had gone to school and learned to be \
a little angry argument machine

and all the dittos slept in the blue \
light of filmstrips about the last war,

and we stood in line for the movie \
about robots who saved everything

with the help of people that taught them \
the essential importance of death

words they did not need to understand \
but only speak when they faced the gate,

then I went home and read the stories \
about Norse Gods and fell into sleep

with its unrealistic drawings \
and never woke up until we met

and this was the dream I remembered: \
mother and father were standing there

each wearing the faces of those ones \
whose benevolence cannot be changed

by actions or time, they are constant \
like a room that hides in an old book

you filled with wildflowers and sunlight.
