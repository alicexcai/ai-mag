In the ninth year,

 a high, bright room

 received the secret wheel.

 Outside, near the sky,

  

 a tangle of trees,

 the sound of sea.

 The spinster,

 her hands showing 

  

 wet, bloody with light,

 shuddered.

 Beneath her weight,

 the stool was still.

  

 She dressed the distaff,

 hairs hanging off

 like cornsilk, unspun—

 a pale, worsted pistil,

  

 which she twisted

 into tufts 

 of fiber, pinned

 to the spindle: speed 

  

 made a swatch 

 of her fingers, 

 braided, unbraided—

 almost touching

  

 the warming thread.

 Being lulled,

 I looked below

 to her naked feet:

  

 to where they beat

 time against the treadle—

 patter-pattern

 without sound.

  

 The wooden machine

 sloughed off the skein.

 I bore it to the basin:

 crushed cochineal,

  

 incarnadine.

 Dripping, it dried,

 caked with color

 like bloodcrust in hair—

  

 I evened the line.

 Slowly the twine

 whispered and wound:

 a sphere.

  

 In this way 

 I gave you 

 a light burden

 to carry unclothed

  

 into the tunnel—

 you will want

 to find your way back.
