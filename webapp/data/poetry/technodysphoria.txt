I’ll be the first to admit it.\
As another swaying casualty,\
I do admire your suspension \
technique. Your feast and famine.\
Your field and fasten. Yes,\
how you slung up that wasp.\
How like a construction-\
paper crown reality now appears. \
The rhomboid jewels losing \
what little span scissors \
and tints lent them. Like sage \
leaves giving way to their grey floss.\
I still don’t know your name. \
Or maybe you told me and I \
404 Error. My index of memories \
obsolesced. The heraldry \
shrunk to point. Classification codes \
dropped their prefixes. Wait, \
maybe I do now remember. \
Your given name. Isn’t it \
404 Error. My mom’s name.\
Brother’s too. The name I cry out \
in the direction of my shoe \
in the rust bluing of morning. \
When I try to make something, \
anything, move. “First things first,” \
404 Error. Who’s or what’s to blame. \
Having used up so much silk \
and hunger, the wasp twists\
in its terminal cocoon. \
It’s not actually requesting \
an apology. No. That’s a salute.
