   I didn’t

 realize there was no grass.

 There was dirt to

 be swept up

 to chant 

 dirt. I have

 seen her in

 the glance (glass)

 of a sun,

 in the light

 up on the dock.

 Under the dirt,

 she calls the salt

 rock she forgot:

 it’s time

 for the ground

 to be beaten by my foot

 and the more

 it happens the more

 I want it to. I didn’t

 realize how dry

 it could be next 

 to the sea

 (we say ocean).

 How she has

 returned, rejecting water

 for the gravel our feet

 make, how it is time

 for us to smile,

 to break the rock in two,

 to pull up the roots,

 and kick

 the hill as

 acorns have stormed

 the ground (I

 mean oak).

I know nothing

of this, I grasp

the dirt I

thought was rock.

I didn’t realize how

much I would

want the water

in the olive grove,

how much

the tree-tops

make a field

that is raised, how

salt pervades,

how I may

have forgot

how much

was one.
