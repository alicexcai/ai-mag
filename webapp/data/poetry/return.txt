 awhile we needed a witness the water couldn’t wait underground another minute

 before becoming spring I’ve never broken a bone before except when twisting it out

 of a bird I am not a patient animal not now not now all the while you were dying all

 the while you were overcome by radiation broken light *s**till light *you said *same*

 *ocean *more than my fingers you said you wanted my fingerbones *this skin *
