I love you, which is a metaphor for the clear fuel   
your eyes have.  The screen has to be moral   
to be transparent, your neck being behind you,  
like a person.  It opens as if I am   
always about to intend an act, that it does  
is grace; I could go into the field with both of my hands   
and the field slightly on them,  
like the scent of metal  
or seeing a face with no tense.   
  
I would be coincident   
with a hologram,   
the accident of it being like a color  
as if hands are colored.  I promise to surveil you   
because the image is what is beautiful.
