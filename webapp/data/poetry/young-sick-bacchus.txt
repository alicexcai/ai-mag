This light yellows  
like a bruise  
when the end’s  
near. Stay here

with me, stung  
smell of lye,  
latherless my arms  
wasting hot, 

 sandalwood fixed  
to lathe and whirring.  
Rowel me on—come, look  
what I’ve done for you, 

 I’ve counted  
these twenty-some grapes  
clinging to sallow stem  
thin as a wick—

 dressed in my finest  
white linen, helix  
of ivy tricked  
into my hair, 

 ibex beauty,  
suspense of black  
grapes hanging off  
this wooden table 

 like an upturned hand—  
pour another, it’s stronger  
than it looks, and table’s ajar,  
nothing will stay put 

today, peaches careening away  
and outside a radio tuning,  
crackling of flies outside  
the window of this rented room, 

 even my tunic’s  
slipping loose, don’t  
look—do you know  
about the great man’s ruby— 

 heavy gleam like  
 sewer water sputtering  
through Rome’s stone gutters  
pinned to his finger, 

 and if you kiss it  
 you catch it, slippery  
as scum. These grapes  
are a long thread 

 of black rubies,  
only indulgence  
I could spare  
today, 

 don’t take them all.  
But just one more?  
As boys we dangled  
the bunches down 

 into each other’s mouths—  
open up—  
sudden breaking  
on tongues muffled 

 grapeskin sticking  
 at the back of the throat  
like a word unvoiced—  
as late one afternoon

 he and I scampered off  
 to the olive grove,  
 fruitless, grey, something like  
abstract statuaries, 

 sun high overhead  
but shadows lengthening  
toward us as we entered  
the stucco-walled field, 

 dusty scent of quartz  
 on the air, and what started  
falling was snow,  
 white as a placebo— 

 how much control  
 do you think I have—  
and his hand inside  
my tunic a warm body, 

 and all that time aware  
of where the yew grows,  
sticks if you stumble,  
let’s not go there— 

 and the bushes  
of prickly rosemary  
are beautiful because  
they move like the soul, 

 piling sharp on sharp  
in weak banks  
too tight to wave in wind,  
and even I will agree, 

 when it snaps  
the smell stays  
in the mind a long time  
like a fugue recorded,

sound of the piano  
bench creaking  
under the man  
with the fingers.

 I’m getting so thin,  
that bench wouldn’t know  
I’m there, or that piano,  
or this table— 

 a bench for you  
 if you’d care to stay,  
toy my ring of ruby  
with your lips, 

 graceful just once more.  
I hope it’s not—  
oh, boys. The wine’s  
a bit young 

 but it will do the trick,  
and do you like  
what you can see,  
all these goodies, 

 they’re only here  
because you are here—  
open up, open up.
