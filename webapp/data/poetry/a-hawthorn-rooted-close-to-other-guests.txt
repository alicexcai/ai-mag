This is not

 nature—the way

 pain interrupts

 its answers, ashen

  

 awl-tipped

 limbs waving

 and brushing them-

 selves, chill crushes

  

 carried across

 the ravine; and

 a wing of 

 their broken flutter,

  

 that desiccated

 battle-din, is

 hooked by a frosty

 steam, and it balds.

  

 Though the awls are

 hollow-point—the un-

 graspable locusts

 having left

  

 behind veins of shadowy

 larvae inside them.

 And the hollowed-out

 scent of cold rain. And

  

 suddenly—a corridor

 of ropy light

 twines round

 the stems and

  

 fills those absent

 bodies with steamy

 voices they cannot

 share, cannot

  

 reveal, retaining

 a skin that shields

 unerringly—And so

 the sudden remains

  

 only as an answer

 the stilled silk

 flowers

 prod-up to reach

  

 on this dog’s grave

 (what symmetry

 can gather itself

 entire, in the

  

 open air?)—a calm

 tended to by

 the wrinkled spines of

 shucked chestnuts.

  

 I would invoke

 the radiance of the mirror

 uncovering itself

 inside the glistering

  

 jetsam-spread of leaves, or

 the receding waves of

 these flowers, fathering

 the dusk into them.
