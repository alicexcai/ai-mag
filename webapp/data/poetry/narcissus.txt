The body near the screen tests itself, rests on itself, akimbo as windowcurtains pinned  
back, just a touch, green kimono cinched in pale rope, as one might flinch if  
pressed into soul’s glinting weight. Quick now, quick, those little lamps  
have all burned down, now your blue dune of breastbone isn’t  
seen except as remembered, and I will not sleep turned  
in here, will not sleep anyplace else than curled in  
streams panned with gold and no, this day is no  
such, pinching into its vise, steadies itself for  
night’s oiled blade, pillow-cold,  
inevitable, not this twisting,  
not I-who-cut-out,  
not I-who-knew-  
who-sang-  
I.
