I am that comet you all have cursed,

 in the dark void drifting aimless and unsettled.

 Love me like an avenger's lost

 last chance at revenge.

  

 I am that person whose shadow was carved on the tree,

 and from that day on taken for dead.

 Love me like a hallucination

 in a crazed killer's fevered brain.

  

 I am that wheat that Heaven too has singed with fire,

 that has shivered even from the dog days' sunlight.

 Love me like a masochist.

 As you cherish reason when the unreasonable surround you.

  

 I am that wolf whose cold bright bones the witch doctor holds in her hand.

 To soil, to air, to flame, to water I will scatter like a spell.

 Love me like miracles not seen even when sun and moon align

 in the sixth degree under the sign of the ram.
