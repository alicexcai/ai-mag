Two birds flew around a branch. 

 You saw this. You saw 

  

 one, struck, fall into what 

 is below and in that water 

  

 stretched by strings it seemed 

 out, feathers at strained 

  

 and calculable ages, still 

 in its geometry, fly in circles 

  

 to the edge. We are all different 

 with some people. In summer 

  

 you found Loretta 

 in a bush. She did not 

  

 recognize you. Where was she 

 going. At the edge, standing, 

  

 you saw the bird step--

 nothing is going to happen 

  

 to you--to where rippling 

 breaks step from reflection, 

  

 out of its depth and pivot 

 down to float back out.
